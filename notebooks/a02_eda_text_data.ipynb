    "This project uses the [consumer complaint database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily.\n",

    "## Purpose\n",
    "Classify consumer complaints into predefined categories.\n",

    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- Multinomial Naive Bayes \n",
