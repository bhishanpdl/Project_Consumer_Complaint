On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, instead of sending me a copy of the verifiable proof that I requested, Experian sent me a statement which reads, \" The information you disputed has been verified as accurate. '' Experian also failed to provide me with the method of \" verification. '' Since Experian neither provided me with a copy of the verifiable proof, nor did they delete the unverified information, I believe they are in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I have been harmed as a result.
