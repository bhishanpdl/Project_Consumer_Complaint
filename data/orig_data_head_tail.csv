1805618,2015-03-26,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I contacted XXXX XXXX, who is a Branch Manager ( XXXX # XXXX ) with GATEWAY FUNDING, and learned I can lower my mortgage monthly payment from approximately {$2400.00} to {$2000.00}. I was ecstatic because I would have saved over {$400.00} each month. XXXX XXXX sent me via email the DETAILS OF TRANSACTION detailing I would pay that amount. During the escrow process on XXXX XXXX, I was instructed to wire {$690.00} and thought my application was completed. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX contacted me and stated it required me to pay an additional {$290.00} because certain expenses were overlooked by XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX about my additional expense to which he stated, GATEWAY FUNDING will refund {$290.00} back to me after I send in the money to complete the escrow process. 

I am complaining about XXXX issues : I learned my mortgage monthly payment was not {$2000.00} as promised by XXXX XXXX, but instead {$2200.00}, and I have not received my refund in the amount of {$290.00}, as promised by XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. When I contacted him via telephone on XXXX XXXX about the monthly payment, he stated he made a mistake. I have contacted XXXX XXXX on XXXX occasions about the refund check. I contacted him via telephone on XXXX XXXX, which he stated he will issue the check on XXXX XXXX, the Friday after the application process was completed. I contacted him on XXXX XXXX, and he stated he would authorize the refund check. When I last contacted him on XXXX XXXX, I was told I should have already received it, then later verified by XXXX XXXX that he check has not been issued or delivered. 

It is my belief XXXX XXXX is taking advantage of my lack of knowledge in the loan application process by informing me of his many years of outstanding services and a promise of lower month mortgage payment only to deceit me to benefit himself.",,Finance of America Mortgage LLC,CA,925XX,,Consent provided,Web,2015-03-26,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1303324
