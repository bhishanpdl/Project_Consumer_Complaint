758416,2017-12-02,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Hello : ditech.com is my mortgage company. They placed an automatic forbearance on my account and removed my auto payment after Hurricane Irma. I called about a week after the storm to ask that they remove the forbearance and return the auto payment. This was confirm by the agent and recorded by them. I received a letter just a few weeks ago stating that my auto payment was never returned and the agent who I spoke with after I received the letter actually read back the notes confirming that I called and asked to have forbearance removed and auto payment reinstated. So I asked again the agent to remove the forbearance and install auto payment. 

I called this past week to check if this was done yet, and the agent at that time said I still have a forbearance and no auto payment. 

As I right this complaint, I spoke with an agent today that informs me that I dont have auto payment and forbearance is still active. She placed me on hold, which has lasted an hour. 

Ditech is not responsive, and it is purposely choosing to keep my in forbearance when I have asked countless times to remove me. I also have asked countless times to reinstate auto payment and yet they choose not to listen.

The promotion is done online only. Citi bank starts counting the days from the day you file the application online. Although the account gets approved in 3-4 days after application, the consumer CAN NOT LOG INTO account until they get a debit card which may take 2-3 weeks. Citibank requires a DEBIT CARD to be Handy to Activate the Account. Without a debit card, the consumer can not ACTIVATE THE ACCOUNT. Infact citibank will not even issue your account number without debit card activation. Hence the consumer is already at a narrow window and only gets 1 week time to deposit the money. In my case, Citibank never sent me a debit card or it got lost in the mail. They resend me the card and hence I already passed the deposit window. Because of this, Citibank states that I am not eligible for the bonus when in fact it was no fault of mine. Citi Bank failed to send me debit card without which I can not activate the account nor deposit money.

Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g ( Sec. 809 ) that the claim that I owe them is not valid, and that I requested validation, and additionally I demanded proof of this debt, specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature, as well as proof of their authority in this matter. Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine. 

I have repeatedly asked them to provide the following, below ( items XXXX ) but would not disclose how they got any of my information in the XXXX place : 1. Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. 2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information? 3. What is your authorization of law for your collection of this alleged debt? 4. Please evidence your authorization to do business or operate in this state. 5. Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 6. Please provide a complete account history, including any charges added for collection activity. This type of practice is not only upsetting but the authority and power these people have over other consumers presumably is also very illegal. They obviously are not willing to provide this which is even further illegal. 

I further ask that you look into the practices of this company and these collection charges brought against me that since it is the Bureaus RESPONSIBILITY to clean up and report accurate, fair, and verifiable information, they are not doing their job.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NC,285XX,,Consent provided,Web,2015-04-26,Closed,Yes,No,1347554

What this should tell you, my initial arguments disputing this debt with you organization hold validity. Enough so, the prospect of reduced company valuation, adding definition to the identified monetary policy loops holes in the FCRA, or debt validation determining the validity of future collection potential as defined by the IRS and Treasury department that will impact the future of your industry. These factors represented enough risk to cease all collection efforts by the parties mentioned above. 

Your collection attempt represents less this .03 % of 1 % of the debt I formerly held before this began in XX/XX/XXXX of this year. I am asking once again the collection item be removed with a mutual understanding no further actions will be taken on my part.

1517224,2018-07-22,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"Over the years, by Nelnet, I was guided to forbearance without a clear understanding of the consequences of interest capitalization. I was told that my loan is simple interest. Even though I am financially prudent and astute, the true meaning of interest capitalization just became clear. 

My credit score went down 50 points from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, because my student loan debt increased. When I contacted Nelnet today, XX/XX/XXXX, for the first time, interest capitalization was clearly explained. Interest capitalization is the reason my loan debt increased, and my credit score decreased by 50 points. 

Also, Nelnet lost my Loan Forgiveness application for {$17.00}, XXXX. The forgiveness process, including when the application was lost and resubmitted, took from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet accrued and capitalized interest during the time the application was lost and while the forgiveness process completed. A Nelnet adviser said today, XX/XX/XXXX that interest accrues at {$4.00} a day so for the approximately 6 months the process took from submission, being lost, and processed the accrued interest is approximately {$830.00}. 

Furthermore, I received two almost identical letters regarding a single forbearance. One letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX and the other XX/XX/XXXX. The 1st letter said the estimated interest to accrue was {$.00}. The second letter said accrued interest was {$4900.00}. Scanned copies are attached. 

Additionally, on XX/XX/XXXX, a Nelnet adviser said that my 10 year loan repayment was {$170.00}. After checking my account today, XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that the payment term is 233 months instead of 120 months, is {$190.00} instead of {$170.00}, and I could pay more than {$20000.00} interest on a {$25000.00} debt. 

I need to make much higher payments to avoid further interest capitalization financial damage. This appears unethical.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",GA,306XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2018-07-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2969675

Since then, the home has gone up considerably in market value, which, when combined with XXXX plus years of principle reduction, brings us well below the requisite XXXX threshold of XXXX % XXXX to drop the PMI. Per XXXX regs, a new appraisal was required. The servicer, XXXX, through its appraisal management XXXX, sent out the same XXXX who had done the original purchase appraisal. The ensuing appraisal report was chock full of errors, omissions and misstatements of material facts, some of which are a matter of public record, falsified his XXXX certifications, used non-comparable sales data while failing to note significant comparable sales data relative to our house. It is compelling and illustrative of the depth of this XXXX 's XXXX, lack of professionalism and failure to exercise ordinary care. Each appraisal done on our home by this same XXXX contains different and conflicting information. As a result, based on garbage in/garbage out XXXX, the ensuing report grossly understated the value of our home and XXXX denied dropping the PMI. We contacted XXXX to dispute the appraisal and wrote a letter of dispute, supported by additional documentation pointing out the erroneous information and omissions on the appraisal report, the fact that the XXXX has a vested interest ( he is also a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in influencing values as well as additional timely comparable sales data ignored by the XXXX which support a market value significantly greater than the falsely arrived at value issued by the XXXX. We, again, requested dropping the PMI. XXXX chose to blatantly disregard the factual and supportive sales data we submitted and again declined our request to drop PMI. Factual errors, omissions and wrongful assumptions and data on the original appraisal report were NOT corrected. They also declined our very specific request to provide detail of who, precisely, was to have performed the so-called "" review. '' IT IS PATENTLY WRONG THAT WE, AS CONSUMERS, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT A DECISION BY THIS LENDER/SERVICER BASED ON A PROVEN ERRONEOUS REPORT.

I bought my first house in XXXX, 2016. First mortgage payment, processed through XXXX Loan Care worked fine in XXXX. I immediately set up autodraft for my loan payments with this successful info. In XXXX, payment did not go through, so I contacted XXXX Loan Care via phone. They instructed me to use the number on the bottom of my checks as the "" account number '' to list on their online form. I did as instructed, received confirmation of payment ( always from LoanCare, occasionally also from XXXX ), and assumed all was fine. Weeks later I received a letter in the mail informing me my payment was not received, and I am now late. I contact XXXX Loan Care again, numerous times to try and resolve, even changing which bank I was using to pull the payment from. Despite making payments with a Loan Care representative on the phone, my payments have still not gone through. When I contacted XXXX to help resolve the issue, I was ignored or run in circles with XXXX Loan Care. I have now been reported as having outstanding late payments on my credit report, which XXXX refuses to take any action to remedy, despite the fact that the only reason I was late is due to misinformation provided to me by their payment processing company. Representatives at XXXX have also sent emails containing ALL of my bank account numbers, causing serious security concerns. The reps at XXXX have been untruthful, dismissive, and damaging to my character and my credit. They have taken to simply ignoring my emails. My credit is being destroyed because of a single late payment which was ONLY late because the processing company gave me bad instructions, and then failed to notify me in anything resembling a timely manner. 

Attempts to pay- XXXX web payment- XXXX/XXXX/16 - successful ( set up autodraft with this info ) XXXX web payment- XXXX - failed - Confirmed successful via email by both companies Contact XXXXLoanCare XXXX - change autodraft to what XXXX Loan Care employee tells me to change it to XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed XXXX + XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed, - Confirmed successful via email by both companies. 

Contact XXXXLoanCare XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed XXXX + XXXX phone pay with rep- XXXX - successful -Confirmed via email by both companies XXXX phone pay with rep- XXXX - failed - Confirmed successful via email by both companies XXXX web pay- XXXX - credited to XXXX XXXX - reported to credit bureaus as 30 days late. At this point XXXX is the only missing payment, but I had no reason to believe XXXX payment was credited to XXXX, nor reason to believe XXXX was late as the representative from XXXX Loan Care had fully confirmed the payment over the phone. 

XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed XXXX web pay- XXXX -??? 

I have tried to resolve this issue with XXXX Loan Care and through my mortgage company, who employs XXXX Loan Care to process their payments. I have contacted 3 different people at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a half dozen different reps at Loan Care. Neither company has made any attempt at actual resolution. 

I am trying to be responsible. I pay all of my bills on time- there is no reason why I would intentionally not pay my mortgage. The money is sitting in my bank account. The only reason I was late at all was because I was told to use the incorrect information to process my payment, and then not notified in a timely manner when it did n't work. The information Loan Care has reported to the credit bureaus is incorrect, and will reduce my credit rating for years to come ( currently, it 's cost me XXXX points on my credit score ).

I received a message from a buyer saying they wanted to buy the item. We then started emailing back and forth. Via XXXX he sent me a check for the amount of {$1500.00}. Clearly i though it was a mistake but no, the buyer instructed me to deduct XXXX for my cost + XXXX for running around for this transaction XXXX for holding the item. i then went to my bank to deposit the check via drive through bank teller. {$300.00} was available right away so i waited for the following day for the full amount of the check to post. When the next day came i seen that i had the full amount of the check available in my account, i believed that meant the check had cleared ... this is where i be leave I 'm not fully responsible for my bank to charge me. The buyer instructed me to send via XXXX a money transfer to the mover who was to pick up the item. So i went to XXXX and did so using my debit card i made a transfer of {$1000.00} ... i thought this guy must be way out of state. I do have receipts and all documentation of this transaction. So i thought all was well, i waited for the movers to come for the item but they never did.., the buyer then contacted me saying the movers wanted more money to pick up the item because of other pickups they had already done for him so he said he will send me another check and to do the same thing. I then became suspicious ... the following morning i seen i had a negative balance on my bank account. Of over XXXX dollars ... this is when my walls caved in ... i could n't believe it ... the bank told me it was a fraudulent check ... right away i went to my local bank to explain the situation but they said it was my fault and I 'm responsible for that charge ... there was nothing they can do ... i do n't have XXXX dollars lying around ... ... i do n't understand how i was able to make a XXXX dollar transfer using my debit card if the bank had not yet cleared the check ... or why would the full amount of the check show posted on my available balance if it really was n't ... of course at this point the buyer stopped responding to me ... but he still had the audacity to send me XXXX more checks ... i feel the bank is at least XXXX percent at fault ... The only reason why i made the transfer was because i saw the full amount of the check available the day after i deposited ... to me that meant the check was cleared and that 's why i was able to make the money transfer. So now my bank is charging me the full amount ... looking back i wish i would have not given any type of trust to this buyer, i was just so happy i had sold my first art piece. I want to get this resolve and i am working with my bank on a payment plan to resolve this issue.

The contract says that the company is only allowed to charge the initial deposit of {$2500.00} to the card ( provided over the phone ). The company charged the entire amount of {$5.00}, XXXX to my account and did not finish the job. Chase asked me to provide documentation indicating that the job was not delivered as promised. I submitted email correspondences to Chase in which the company, XXXX XXXX XXXX abandoned the job and did not complete it. When Chase sent the decision letter, ruling in favor of the merchant, they said that I never submitted a second opinion- which was not requested. I did seek a second opinion and hired XXXX XXXX XXXX to redo the framing that was done by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( it was done incorrectly ) and to frame the rest of the house ( what the first company was paid to do but did not complete ). Additionally, in the first contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was paid {$10000.00} to demolish all of the walls in the house.. this was also not completed. This is the second time that the merchant was paid to complete a job and did not do it.

If the contract is not signed, then he did not have permission to charge any amount to my account.

Conclusion : contract was not signed, merchant did not have permission to charge {$5000.00} to my Chase Visa card Work done by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was incomplete and faulty. I hired another company to correct and to complete his work.

31413,2019-04-25,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I have been upset by the high interest rates and high fees of 3 credit cards I have with US bank in addition to the bank 's sudden drop of my credit limits on one visa. Also, I wish to report the non existent customer service of this bank and the only call center employee who ever answers my calls, XXXX. This self hating man is prejudiced, inflexible, and low spirited. He sounds more like a criminal than a customer service person. Last time I spoke to him was tonight XX/XX/2019 around XXXX. But here I will concentrate on other 3 problems. 1- I learned tonight that US bank is charging me over 25 % for one visa, over % 23 for another, and over % 21 for a third because the bank 's assessment is that I dont have the means to pay my debt! If this is the reasoning, then US bank is made up of psychos who hope with higher interest rates on someone with difficult situation, they make sure the person never meets their obligations. Here I am asking that US bank fires such psychos in the underwriting department and hires people who can help us get lower interest rates such as 5 % so we can pay our bills. The other problem of US bank is that it has charged me several times {$38.00} fees for late payments. I want all of that stolen money returned to me. I have indeed never been late. The problem is that the bank considers central time for the closing of its banks as the cut off time while for me living in CA and other States, its difficult to always remember central time. Just like other banks US bank should follow an exact schedule rather than a confusing cut off time. Additionally, in or around XXXX to XX/XX/2019, the bank had a failing website. For example, in XXXX I had completed my payments on the site but later I found out the site wasnt working and my payments never went through. So I was charged {$38.00} and the belligerent call center men in Idaho denied me the return of my dollars even if I had proof of how i was mislead by the site. The third complaint is about the belligerent treatment I received from US bank underwriters who reduced the credit limit of one of  my visas and hiked my interest rates from already high % 17 to higher % 21-25. The  real reason for this increase was that shortly before I had called a phone number on TV promising to help consumers lower their credit card interest rates! Although the phone call was purely informational, and I never intended to hire that company, the US bank acted in retaliation by reducing my credit limit and raising my interest rates. The unethical behavior of US bank employees has disgusted me especially their rudeness to disregard my appeal. Last but not the least, Im asking the company to diversify its customer service to beyond Idaho and prejudiced self hating men in call centers. There are many good people all over US who need jobs and US bank could do much better.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,TX,78732,,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3222270

I immediately called XXXX and was told that the account had been opened. Explained that I did not open the account and it needed to be investigated. Was treated like I was lying by the fraud rep. She told me ( BUT THE ACCOUNT MATCHES YOUR ADDRESS ). Told her that I did not apply for the account and did not want it. She finally told me that They would close the account and investigate. And then they did not provide any kind of claim number or advise further action. Knowing they did not believe my claim I disputed with the major credit Bureaus.

I live in XXXX XXXX and all of the Transactions are from XXXX XXXX  Including one fromXX/XX/XXXX The day the account was opened and have proof I was at a XXXX XXXX XXXX location in XXXX that day.

XX/XX/ Received notification from XXXX  that they verified the account as mine and the dispute is closed.

XX/XX/XXXXWas transferred to the the Account security department and was told that they just recently opened an investigation and had to wait 90 days.

I understand that if they know it is fraud they must remove the account and inquiries from my report immediately. She then said they submitted it to be removed and placed all of the blame on the credit bureaus and said I had to give them 60 days to remove it. I explained again that they just verified this a legitimate account when they know it is fraud and that it is against FCRA laws. She again blamed the bureaus. I asked for future status updates and was denied because they don't do that.

179585,2020-04-22,Debt collection,Medical debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I was a patient at XXXX XXXX in XXXX SC. I was seen numerous times before my XXXX was scheduled. It is XXXX  XXXX  policy that all payment is due before or at time of service. On the day of my XXXX I was given a form to sign stating everything in detail that I owe. I was given a statement of what my insurance was paying and also told that insurance was not a guarantee of payment. However in this case my insurance paid EVERYTHING 100 % that was told and documented to XXXX XXXX. Of particular interest on the copay line for their XXXX center it was listed as XXXX. As I do not have a deductible or copayment with my insurance unless I am using is called an ambulatory XXXX center. As it is not often one has to have XXXX and I am not in the medical field to know the medical jargon. I rely on the patient assistance/financial assistance, and what is written on paper to make my financial decisions as to the place of medical treatment. The last appointment before my XXXX I was asked as to my preference to use XXXX  XXXX center or an affiliated hospital. I advised whatever would be the most affordable option. In my case with my particular situation I would only have been responsible for a small portion of the bill had I used an affiliated hospital. However as you can see on their website they state their center usually saves insurance companies hundreds of dollars and it is clearly advocated to use their XXXX center. After reviewing the document and signing before my XXXX I was told my copay for this facility in which the XXXX was performed would be XXXX. This is a simple oversight on XXXX  XXXX. I was told I was paid in full less than a week later. To verify I logged into XXXX  XXXX  online payment portal to verify I had a zero balance. A month later I received a bill for {$480.00}. As soon as time permitted I called and spoke with the head of the financial department and she said she was unsure why I had a balance of that amount. She also said she would send me all the transcripts of my payment history. A week or so later I received a huge stack of letters not showing a simple account ledger and payment form but pages of insurance codes payments from my insurance company subtractions from my insurance company, subtractions from XXXX XXXX, sporadic listings of my personal payments via their online portal and payments made to the actual XXXX center. As I am not a medical worker or involved in any type of medical coding I could not make any since of what I had received in the mail. I called back to speak with XXXX XXXX and she advised me to call my insurance company and ask a patient advocate. After waiting for my insurance company to get back to me about another month later at this point they told me everything had been paid. I owed a XXXX copayment for using their ambulatory XXXX center instead of using one of my local hospitals affiliated with XXXX XXXX. At this point I called back and spoke with XXXX XXXX and I explained the situation. This is when I was informed that they have two billing systems so some people may had told me my balance was XXXX because their system is not affiliated with their own XXXX centers billing system. She advised me I could make a payment arrangement and I advised her I would call her back within the week as I would need time to figure out where to acquire this unexpected money that I had not budgeted because I had been told numerous times my balance was paid in FULL. Less than a week later I called the billing department to make a payment arrangement and was informed my bill had been sent to collections. I asked if I could still pay them and I was abruptly cut off by a resounding NO. I then asked to speak with XXXX XXXX, head of billing and I was not able to get through. I then called back and left a voicemail with no return. I called and left another voicemail and again no return call. I do not find it fair that I have to pay an excessive amount of money because I was misinformed, not once but many times, by many people, and via their own payment portal. With this being said, when I spoke with XXXX XXXX, I did not dispute the charge. She said she would absolutely allow me to make a payment arrangement. Now I am receiving letters from Choice Recovery , Inc., a collection agency. If arrangements can not be make to have this removed from this credit agency and an arrangement to make payments to XXXX XXXX I will pursue every option I have available including seeking legal advice. {$500.00} may seem a small amount to hire a lawyer over, however if my credit is adversely affected I will use every agency, and legal authority at my disposal. I have already filed a complaint with several agencies, including the XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX your organization is part of, as well as our states Attorney General XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX.

1479699,2018-07-30,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Earlier this year, I rightfully disputed my debt to Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC for {$790.00}, which was purchased from a closed XXXX   XXXX credit card in XX/XX/XXXX. After Portfolio Recovery Associates validated my debt, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to pay off the debt. I explicitly told the representative that I am paying off the debt for full removal from my credit report, and the representative stated that a full deletion would not occur unless paid in full. With the sole purpose of removing the debt from my credit report, I paid the debt of {$790.00} in full on that call. 

However, the paid collection was not removed on my credit report, and still reflected a charge-off on my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a certified letter to Portfolio Recovery Associates to review my call with the representative, and to have my paid collection removed from my credit report. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Portfolio Recovery Associates dated XX/XX/XXXX that they would not conduct an investigation of my dispute and claim of misrepresentation. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to ask again to review my call and request for full deletion. The representative I spoke to referred me to a supervisor and they both explained that full deletions are not offered by Portfolio Recovery Associates. In addition, the supervisor stated that : - a complaint had already been filed on my account ( I never filed a complaint before ) - they will review my call - apologized for any incorrect information that was given to me. 

If I was given full disclosure with the original representative that a deletion was not available, I would have offered a settlement for far less than a payment in full. There is no incentive to a paid-in-full collection that still reports negatively as a charge-off on my credit report. 

Portfolio Recovery Associates is not fully representing the consequences of a paid collection to those looking to pay their debts in full. I did not deny the debt and take responsibility for it with full payment, however, I would have made a different decision to pay a settlement, not paid in full.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,FL,322XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-07-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,2976384

This is a new complaint filed by XXXX XXXX XXXX for unlawful debt collection practices and unlawful non-Judicial foreclosure action taken by Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. ( hereafter SPS Inc. ), XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX f/k/a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereafter XXXX ), where each of them, ( collectively Respondents ' ) are threatening to seize, attach, and sale our property in a unlawful non-judicial foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX although Respondents ' holds "" NO SECURED INTEREST '' in our property for the following REASONS : ( a ), The Transaction is rescinded effective by operation of law on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX nor its agents or representative filed a legal response within 20 days after service. thus, the note, deed and contract is void as a matter of law, see EX-D2 ; and ( b ) prior to the rescission, the Transaction was already a nullity from its INCEPTION in that the deed and other documents were SIGNED by an unauthorized agent for its principal, in violation of Georgia law which says, "" Where an agent without authority to execute a sealed instrument signs a contract under seal for his principal, the later is not bound unless ratification thereof be also under seal. XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' See unauthorized signer at EX-S1 ; and ( c ) A permanent sale was made and not recorded, the ASSET was transferred out of the alleged TRUSS to XXXX XXXX XXXX on or before XX/XX/XXXX. See EX-D7. <P/>2. We also have evidence and good cause to believe that SPS Inc., & XXXX filed the present foreclosure action under a MODIFIED fictitious name instead of using it 's legal registered fictitious name as required by the State of NY Article 3 - 301 and state of GA Real estate Comm. Ch. 40 ( a ) and ( c ) ( 2 ). <P/>3. The foreclosure Sale Under Power notice IS NOT BROUGHT by the party identified in the security deed neither is it brought by the party listed on the first and only DEED ASSIGNMENT as required by Georgia Real estate Comm.

"" It also says : "" The published notice must contain the name of the Lender '' 4. XXXX, SPS Inc., and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, used Concealment and misrepresentation of a material fact, to disguise its true "" descriptive '' fictitious name. <P/>5. Under Chapter 40 ( a ) and ( c ) ( 2 ), XXXX and SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX always use the following legal fictitious name for non-judicial foreclosures actions, see EX D-2A, which is a XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Notice of Sale Under Power publication, where the following legal name is asserted as true under the statutory requirement of Georgia. <P/>( d ) '' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX f/k/a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, As Trustee For The Certificateholders XXXX, XXXX, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series XXXX. <P/>6. In the NEW Sale Under Power Notice, Respondents ' abandoned a key "" descriptive '' term in its registered fictitious name they are require to use by the PSA. Note that Respondent, in the paragraph below, did not use the descriptive portion of its registered fictitious name that identifies XXXX as the trustee "" For the Certificateholders ''. -- - Instead, Respondent used the following fictitious name omitting and disguising its legal fictitious name per the PSA requirement.

See EX- ( D-5 ) which shows unsolicited documents sent to us by Respondents ' purported servicer, SPS Inc. which shows Respondent 's laying the foundation for the insertion of a modified or alternant version of the Truss legal fictitious name to be relied upon by us, the Court and CFPB as true and correct. See EX- ( D-5 )  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of a material fact on behalf of XXXX by concealment of facts in response to The CFPB, and because it is a legal tribunal an if they use the key descriptive term, i.e. "" for the certificateholder '' in referring to our purported loan account, it can be considered perjury. so Respondent used an alternant term in its place. <P/>9. eight ( 8 ) foreclosure notices were served in XX/XX/XXXX, and now yet another one has been served. it amount to racketeering where senior citizens like ourselves are the target.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",GA,303XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2017-07-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2563165

I have been on the Total and permanent XXXX program since XX/XX/XXXX and was supposed to be done with the 3 year monitoring program as of XX/XX/XXXX. I did everything I was supposed to do to be qualified for the program. And for the first two years everything went smoothly. However, two months after I was supposed to be off of the program I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX telling me that my loans of {$71000.00} were being reinstated because my employment earning exceeded the {$16000.00} limit for the time between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This is false and they have been harassing me and threatening my credit history, earning wages and that the loans would be reinstated as of XX/XX/XXXX. I asked them several times how much I supposedly went over and they refused to give me answer except for sending me an equation on how they came to the determination that I was over the limit. They also, told me they were determining the amount on future wages I had not errand yet. Which by law they can not use future erranings that I have not made against me. For the whole year of XX/XX/XXXX I made a total on my XXXX of {$11000.00} and if you divide that by half it is only {$5900.00} because they are only using the XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to the end of XX/XX/XXXX. And if you take my wages errand from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX I errand {$9900.00}. This gives you a grand total of {$15000.00} and the last time I checked this is under the {$16000.00}. 

When I contacted Nelnet their answer was that I could apply again for the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX program and be monitored for another 3 years! I told them that I 've done what they asked and that my loans should have been discharged and forgiven and that I did not have to reapply for that reason. They refused and refused to give me any information on how to appeal the decision or the amount I supposedly made that put me over. 

So, my first payment of {$550.00} is due on XX/XX/XXXX and the bill I received stated that I owed {$45000.00}. However, I signed into Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX and it states that I owe a total of {$71000.00} and that my first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX is {$830.00}. The amount continues to change and the payment amount continues to change. How do they expect someone who is on SSI XXXX and works part-time to pay {$830.00} a month? That is almost all the money I make in the month. I am barely feeding myself and keeping gas in my car but, yet they feel I 'm making more than enough to pay back almost {$900.00} a month. I have no means or way to pay them back and I have a letter from my XXXX doctor stating that I will never be able to function normally to the point that I can hold permanent full-time work. Also, SSI has stated that in the last review of my case that nothing has changed with my status of XXXX and that it was not going to change in the future due to my XXXX. Nelnet is placing an undue hardship on me. 

I am currently seeking the advice of a Student loan lawyer in this matter due to the undue hardship they are putting on me. I was told that I should contact the CFPB in this matter first however, if they continue to refuse to not discharge my loans. And continue to harass me, destroy my credit or try to go after my wages then I have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and ask for a special Adversary hearing with a Judge.

I encourage you to read all the complaints of Bank of America from consumers. I honestly had the hardest time with the banks, and the banks are whining? I was never reimbursed for a check fraud complaint with the XXXX with BAC. I had lost my job, my car and wanted to short-sale my home. The XXXX answer was there is nothing we can do about it. 
I wanted to short-sale my home sooner but the Management Company of my condo refused to provide the realtor with the keys. I filed a motion to stay the sale. The Bank never called me. I filed several documents that were requested as a home modification. I am working part-time and I filed all my hardship documents. 
My realtors attorney filed the correct paperwork, and the bank lied and said that the documents were not there according to XXXX XXXX at Bank of America when XXXX XXXX stated all I needed was a copy of my license and this was all I needed. In fact, I know the bank lied because an employee of the bank requested that a XXXX form re-completed by XXXX XXXX, which was in part of the attorneys documents. The foreclosure attorney XXXX XXXX who works at XXXX XXXX , XXXX in XXXX would not return my calls, because as a consequence my short sale never happened ( the bank refused ), and put me through XXXX.

I even escalated this issue to Management XXXX XXXX and she did nothing prior to the Bank making me go through all kinds of steps prior to a short-sale, which was denied.

I had no access to the service either, as again, I never received ANY communication from them, so I never received a username and password or any instructions on how to access the recurring service. I, to this day, have not used the service they signed me up for, and since it 's just a website with a credit report on it, never received anything from them, nor did they incur any costs since nothing was ever delivered. 

I did, on a one time basis, access my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX, after the XXXX hack. That charge was for {$4.00}. I assume that they signed me up for the recurring service then, and deceptively did not CLEARLY state I was signing up for a service. 

I discovered the issue last year in XX/XX/XXXX when I reviewed my XXXX XXXX credit card statements and realized the recurring charges. I initially attempted to contact Experian, but could not reach them after being on hold over the phone for over an hour. So I then sent a dispute to XXXX XXXX XXXX. After several weeks ( was traveling to see family over XXXX ) with no response from XXXX XXXX, I contacted them again to dispute the charges. Yesterday, I finally received several emails from XXXX XXXX indicating that the charges would be rebilled to my account. 

I then contacted Experian again this morning by calling XXXX and was on hold for over 1 hour and 30 minutes ( I have a screenshot to prove it ) and was finally able to get a customer service agent on the phone. 

The customer service agent I spoke with is named 'XXXX ' on team 'XXXX ' within the customer service center. This agent said that they could not remove the charges. I then spoke with his manager 'XXXX ' (  agent # XXXX ) and she would not remove the charges either. 

The charges total {$170.00}. The charges occurred from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Please see the attached screenshot of the charges from my online XXXX XXXX account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CA,91942,,Consent provided,Web,2018-01-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2781302

'' At the onset of the scheduled court hearing ( case ), I was attacked at my home business ; the home invasion felony false pretense forced entry -- two Auto Lock Locksmith 's w/a gang of about ten others started removing the front door locks on my home business building : not on my XXXX XXXX XXXX that's still locked inside my garage being stolen -- armed robbery grand theft larceny assault has NOT ended. I was forced to rent a motel room for my safety and living necessity : I rented XXXX # XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX AZ XXXX. The property management said : yes, but we don't get paid the money ; there was no one who could really ask for payment. 

AmEx billed me slightly over {$3600.00} ( three thousand, six hundred ) and after the XXXX XXXX XXXX owner/manager merchant could not respond to dispute : AmEx refunded {$600.00}. AmEx -- not any rightful owed merchant : the room was legally not rentable in accordance to AZ state laws -- stole {$3000.00} from me by demanding I pay a motel bill that only AmEx employees were charging. XXXX XXXX XXXX did not have a valid merchant bank account : AmEx knew it. I only got the {$600.00} back after the very same man who held me at gunpoint at my home business ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) arrived at the motel to order me out of XXXX # XXXX, despite my already having paid AmEx for it ( in advance by a week : my week quite up yet ). 

I relocated across the street to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX AZ XXXX where I was constantly told my money payment -- what I was paying to AmEx for 'XXXX XXXX XXXX ' XXXX # XXXX rent -- wasn't as good as no payment at all or certainly not as good as invalidated bogus bank ( XXXX money ) card payments. I finally was forced to relocate to a back room that is not rentable for money payment either ( in accordance to AZ state law ). AmEx has billed me {$4800.00} for XXXX # XXXX at the XXXX XXXX : but "" XXXX '' has not been paid any of it. XXXX XXXX does not have a valid merchant bank account for AmEx to pay with my money. BUT I'VE HAD TO PAY MY AMEX BILL -- or lose my card priviledges -- AND MY PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN DEBITED ( subtracted ) OUT OF MY AMEX SAVINGS ACCOUNT available balance : it's just not been paid anyone. The only entity billing me for charges on my AmEx card is AmEx : over {$16000.00} worth since XXXX XXXX! And that's how much has been debited ( subtracted ) from my AmEx savings account available -- for my needs -- balance. AmEx is NOT paying any of the merchants for the charges on my card : they do not have valid merchant bank accounts to get paid. AmEx employees think they can force me into death or irreparable homelessness and unemployment dispair by stealing all my money and by not really stealing : it's all still inside my AmEx savings account or it's only debited ( subtracted ) on the bank account statements AmEx presents to me. For my practical purpose : over {$16000.00} has been stolen and even if only by relocation in my account to "" unavailable balance '' ... 

When XXXX and then XXXX immediately thereafter ( by order of US Fed Reserve Bank-US Treasury ) closed XX/XX/XXXX, all the merchants -- XXXX, USPS, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and more : it was like a distortion of communism that evolved from the mass FDIC bank failure crisis XXXX -- lost their merchant account pay ( bank ) arrangement.

Since that time, AmEx has demanded I pay only AmEx for my purchase charges because NO ONE ELSE IS REALLY CHARGING ME AND THE REASON IS THEY CAN NOT GET PAID : THEY DON'T HAVE VALID MERCHANT ACCOUNTS AT BANKS TO PAY. The merchants all say they aren't really charging me but AmEx is charging and debiting my AmEx savings account balance. If I don't get the money reinstated to my AmEx savings account "" available '' balance, no one will ever get the use the money. Why AmEx does it : to dangle the theft amount like a golden carrot to enable stealing money from even more victims and specifically, from other AmEx employees. 

The point to it -- however -- is moot : AmEx employees and all that's left of the public majority have less than -XXXX- money and no money access. It's indefinite : they will never have/earn or own any money of their own and they do not care -- they are all in invalidated bogus bank card use heaven right now : while supplies last -- because they all psychotically thought the only income they were being paid was money being stolen from murdered victims. That NEVER HAPPENED : they were not being allowed to steal any money from other persons ( dead or alive ) but that brain damaged understanding is why they were more than happy to get only XXXX "" spend '' for ever $ XXXX "" negative balance credit debit '' on what was their XXXX/XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) pay/debit cards. All the bogus bank pay/debit cards were invalidated, XXXX XXXX ; it's over. It will never happen again. 

I have not -- despite legitimate efforts to regain safe passage/access to my property by court order -- been able to be at my home business because they all think they can murder me to use my money and property to support themselves instead ... Who are they?! Nearly every other person including American Express employees as a leader of their pack : almost the entire population is now just XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ; not one productive affluent -- educated, healthy, income earning, fine business reputation, property owner, tax payer -- person can live anywhere at the US without suffering chronic assault.

I went back to work in XXXX, but now my mortgage is about 4 months behind, and Ive made my usual payment since then. All of my savings was used up while I was off work for almost 7 months. After returning to work, I was encouraged to reapply for the loan modification in hopes of saving my house. It was also denied on XX/XX/2018, because my obligations exceed my income. Isnt that why I need the modification? I called on that day and spoke to a representative ( who told me why my modification was denied ) and asked who I could file a complaint with against their company and was told that my loan was an FHA loan so the FHA is my lender, and they dont take phone calls.

3. Please fully review and address credit card history from the start of the card throughXX/XX/XXXX. 
*First, Please remove of all postal charges to all items added on my account, as I have only ordered items with the Advertised return shipping labels. I have met all requested steps to comply with returning items as needed with the appropriate labels. 
4. Next, please review my XXXX history and XXXX posted amounts on all of my purchased items, to ensure that I was billed correctly with the appropriate price on the items/w taxes, that I currently have now. ***This step is not negotiable as my last billing statement alone had multiple billing payment errors on it.

5. Please view and address all over payments ... ..with the interest charges on my credit card account for each month and CREDIT my account back accordingly.

I am very disappointed in XXXX customer service and XXXX XXXX XXXX with the handling of my account to date. I am stressed and frustrated and I want these basic issues addressed on my account ASAP. I just want to get account paid off and get XXXX and bank out of my life.

I am done with both XXXX customer service and XXXX  XXXX telling me to call one another in order to fix my problems and I'm tired of being ignored. 
***BOTH complanys have worked to create this mess and they both need to work together to fix errors. 


As of XX/XX/XXXX : Both companys REFUSE to fix my acct or talk with me, acct continues to spiral out of control with interest and both company are continuously harassing me thru : calling me, texting me and email me to pay my bill. 
The first major problem I had is XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card XXXX XXXX XXXX  would not identify if they were the same agency or two separate agencies in this process. Neither agency would clearly identify what their role in the billing process was, so I found myself very confused throughout this process in trying to get my issues address. Neither agency took the dispute of my balance seriously. Both agencies has allowed my disputed balance from XX/XX/XXXX to "" snowball '' into added interest and in XX/XX/XXXX have started massively harassing me to pay my bills : by text messages, emails and numerous automated calls to my phone. I find this harassive and stressful. 
I have contacted the Better Business Bureau in Florida and Ohio on both agencies and there was no response from the companies to resolve the issues on my acct. I have gone on to report issue to the Federal Trade Commission and to the Consumer Finance public Bureau for resolution. To date both companies REFUSE to help resolve my acct issues. 

**Consumers need to be aware of how their XXXX credit card is being mannipulated and fraudulently being handled. With what I have been finding out of over time, XXXX and bank, owes me money. 
1. I have been randomly charged postal fees for return items even though I have used the free return labels as instructed by XXXX. 
2. I have returned unwanted items back to XXXX in a very timely manner however those returns have been held until the next billing cycle. This has caused 26 % interest charges in items that i did have and that I found out, that the company held. I see this as fraudulent. 
3. I have been sending over- payments monthly to my credit card, to pay off items that I wanted to buy. What I found out however is that the items that were on XXXX XXXX XXXX, is locked in for those months, selected, with no exceptions. I see this is fraudulent. 
* '' * Consumers are not aware of this as this clearly does not give the consumer the sales or special prices on items that they purchased. * '' *Faliure to inform consumer ... ... 
4. I have also asked XXXX customer service where my extra money has been gone and they WILL NOT TELL ME where my over payments have gone, over the time of my account history. 3yrs I see this as fraudulent. 
5. neither agency appear to want to help me with my ongoing account concerns. Each agency tells me to call the other. 
6. I found out in this process that the bank in XX/XX/XXXX had a major lawsuit against them for mishandling of cinsumer accounts. I am finding myself currently in a similar situation from the issues that were going on in XX/XX/XXXX with this Bank. 
7. doing this process I have constantly been referred to call the front line clerks about my issues.

BOTH AGENCIES XXXX XXXX XXXX   ALSO VERIFIED THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF DISPUTED BALANCE OR ANY OTHER NEED AS LISTED ON THE ACCOUNT THEY HAD ACCESS TO. I found this very unprofessional of both agencies to "" dump '' this level of concerns on their line workers. 


8. it has become clear that I AM owed money and not the other way around but company s are doing everything possible to not acknowledge this. I DO NOT APPRECIATE ANYONE STEALING FROM ME. 

9. XXXX ADVERTISING PRACTICES AND POLICIES CLEARLY DON'T MATCH WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THE XXXX CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT AND CONSUMERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THIS. 

8. it is very clear that I am the only one working to resolve my issues, while both companies sit back and let my account balance get out of control. I do not want my credit damaged because of their incompetence and I feel that consumers at this point need to be 100 % informed of what's going on. 
Consumers need to closely review their accounts overtime and contact the : The Federal Trade Commission and/or cfpb to what's going on with their accounts. 
Otherwise consumers will continue to be taken advantage of, overcharged for items that they're thinking they're getting sales prices on and will find out there is no reporting process with either company to address acct issues. 
Both companies clearly have no interest in addressing any account issues with the consumers that they serve. 
**What started out with a personal issue with the wrong balance of my account, has now spiraled into much bigger concerns to consumers in general and the issues do need to be addressed immediately.

1337271,2015-12-31,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I went to BMO Harris to open an account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. When I inquired about overdrafts, the personal banker XXXX XXXX was confusing the opt-in and opt-out terminology. He stated that opt-out meant my overdrafts would be paid. He said everyone was opted out automatically and they could change to opt-in and not pay overdrafts. I said, "" Really at XXXX they said opt-in meant paying overdrafts. '' I finally forced him to find me a copy of the account terms and conditions he was making me acknowledge receiving. He had no idea what I was requesting and tried to tell me the signature card page I signed was the Deposit Account Agreement and then tried to say the pricing schedule was it. I was persistent that there were additional account terms he had n't provided and they likely called it a handbook. He ran to a different area of the branch to look for one. Why are n't the account opening disclosures available at the desk where they make you open an account? Why does n't the personal banker know what the account agreement is? Finally, when he came back with the booklet ( Deposit Account Agreement ), I quickly flipped to the overdraft section and showed him the page on overdrafts. I read him the line that said opt-in meant paying my overdrafts and I wanted to be opted in. He said, "" Oh, I was confusing the terms, but I can easily check a box to change that. '' I said, "" I do n't have to do anything else? '' and he said, "" no. '' I did not receive a separate notice describing the overdraft practice or a confirmation of opt-in. 

I called the XXXX number to inquire about my opt-in status on XXXX/XXXX/15 since I did n't receive an overdraft confirmation or notice. She confirmed I was opted in. She said most people opt-in online. She could n't explain why I did n't get the disclosures but put me on hold to talk to XXXX at the branch. When the person came back she said XXXX would mail the overdraft disclosures to me. XXXX mailed me the handbook and privacy policy but no overdraft disclosure or confirmation. 

I went to close my account on XXXX/XXXX/15 the Service Manager XXXX XXXX told me that I would be charged a fee if I closed my account, but I could talk to a banker to see about waiving the fee. I explained I was closing my account because they were n't complying with the regulations. The supervisor did n't care to ask what the violation was and he refused to let me withdraw the {$100.00} that was in my account. I was forced to go talk to the same banker who does n't understand overdrafts to get the account closing fee waived and then go back to the teller line to wait for a cashier 's check. I deposited cash and asked for cash to be returned to me, why was I forced to get a cashier 's check. It is hugely surprising that a supervisor is unable to waive a fee or did n't care about the details of a regulatory violation. 

I think this is a problem that has impacted several other customers. The personal banker does n't give out the deposit account agreement unless a person is forceful like I was. He tried to tell me the XXXX page "" Individual Signature Card '' was the agreement. Even after I read the sentence about acknowledging receipt of the Handbook, he was unsure for what I was looking. Neither the personal banker nor the call center agent and XXXX understand what the required process is to comply with the Regulation E overdraft regulations. Then, when I point out their noncompliance and my desire to close my account, they want to charge me a fee.

In my humble opinion, their 'investigation ' could be concluded with a 5 minute call to the County Treasurer ; and, 5 ) an email attachment dated XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had paid the original amount of the tax. Apparently it never occurred to anyone a Ditech that taxes paid nearly 4 1/2 months late would incur penalty and/or interest. The second attachment consists of my letter to Ditech dated XX/XX/XXXX. It addresses not only the unpaid real estate tax issue, but also the failure of Ditech to pay from escrow the premium on flood insurance that they forced us to purchase. There are several exhibits to this letter and I will be glad to provide them if needed. The third attachment consists of my letter to Ditech dated today, XX/XX/XXXX. It addresses the real estate tax and flood control insurance issues as well as my inquiry about a questionable payment from the escrow account.

I brough the balance down, despite having XXXX kids to support. I now owe {$50000.00}, graduated XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, and have been making payments for the last 9 years. I worked for XX/XX/XXXX all my life. I am looking to buy a house, so really hoped this process would clear up some cash by the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally told that my payments of 9 years are not valid as I did not have loans with XXXX  since I began to make payments. I needed to sign up for some special payment plan to be eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX. I was never told about this by anyone. And believe me I do paperwork for a living, so I looked all over for this info. This seems to be yet another trap by the big corporations to keep me paying endlessly for loans. 

Just a final note, I made about {$80000.00} last year, married, with XXXX kids. When I did their Income Contingent payment plan I was told I needed to pay over {$900.00} a month ( myself ). When I called XX/XX/XXXX, to see if it can be changed, I was told I could do another, meaningless plan, and pay {$420.00} a month, less than what I paid for the less 9 years. 

I hope you can take my extremely negative experience and find a way to make consumers be able to stop paying endless college loans and invest into the economy. This program seems to be another scam to keep me paying into endless existence. I plan to change my loans to my previous provider and keep my {$600.00} payment as I did before. I will end up paying off my loan within 10 years without this company making money off of me. What a sham!!!",,AES/PHEAA,NY,113XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-01-31,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2799642

1254895,2015-11-24,Credit card,,Rewards,,"My credit card, ( Chase Visa, XXXX ), offers a 3 % rebate on "" Home Improvement '' purchases. I 'm purchasing {$900000.00} approx in hard wood floor, carpeting, and tile for my home. ( {$2000.00} pr month ) They are refusing to give me the 3 % stating that the point of purchase, ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL ), is not listed as "" HOME IMPROVEMENT '', but are listed or classified as "" Flooring and Floor Coverings. '' I 'm sorry, but that is exactly what "" Home Improvement '' is, flooring and floor coverings. While talking to the CS rep. I asked, "" If I buy the same products from XXXX, would it be considered "" HOME IMPROVEMENT? '' She replied, "" Yes, XXXX is considered "" home improvement '', but your store is classified as "" Flooring and Floor Coverings. '' When I asked to be transferred to someone further up the ladder I was told they could not do that. Basically, I 'm being blockaded from speaking to anyone that has the authority to correct the problem. It comes down to how a store is coded and it is the coding that dictates if a purchase gets 3 % or 1 %. They advertise 3 % on "" Home Improvements '', but it 's only if the store is coded as a home improvement store and they dictate how a store is coded. I requested a list of stores that were coded "" Home Improvement '' and they said they could only tell me but not send me a list. They also could not tell me until after the purchase was made. "" Catch XXXX '' They also offer 3 % on gas, but if I buy gas at a XXXX or XXXX convenience store, does it go down as gas at 3 % or general merchandise at 1 %? They 're playing a game and it 's cheating their customers out of a rebate that they deserve. The product is the product regardless of how they deem the store classification. 
This is a classic trick in that they offer no breakdown on the statements as to what the rebate amount is for each purchase and therefore the customer never knows that he is being cheated, or would a term like "" mislead '' be more appropriate. How can I find out the -rebate amount for each and every purchase on my statement, when I get my statement. 
- I spoke to one of the Presidents and an owner of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and explained the situation to him. He was not aware of how they were classified and found my situation disturbing. When I told him they were classified as "" Flooring and floor coverings '', he stated, "" Yes, we are that, but that is also Home Improvement! '' His main concern, other than my situation, is that he could be loosing business to XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX XXXX just because of a coding error or glitch. 
Basically, it comes down to one thing, "" The banks trying to scam their customers. '' It 's as bad as the politicians back in the XXXX trying to get away with stuff that was not legal by saying that XXXX was not a "" WAR '', it was a "" Police Action. '' Hopefully someone who is reading this recalls and knows exactly what I 'm talking about. 
OK, the ball is now in your court. Let 's see where you get in trying to talk to someone that has the authority to make the correct call. This is upsetting me so much I 'm considering going "" VIRAL '' with my complaints. I wish I had a video of my conversations with Customer Service. Especially when I get someone in XXXX or XXXX on the other end of the line. Their refusal to kick me up the ladder to someone with more authority says a lot about their so called "" Customer Service. '' On one previous call I was told that the store was mis-coded and the problem would be corrected. That does not appear to have happened. 
Thanking you in advance for any and all consideration.

705790,2017-08-30,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,"Impersonated attorney, law enforcement, or government official","On XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a corporate housing lease agreement, under the umbrella of XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, a structured Nevada corporation with the XXXX XXXX XXXX located in the city of XXXX XXXX, CA. 

Inspite of receiving a three-day notice on XX/XX/XXXX to pay rent or quit, for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and in correlation with being served with a Complaint Unlawful Detainer on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the past due rent for XX/XX/XXXX, along with XX/XX/XXXX rent etc, and as instructed left a XXXX XXXX XXXX cashiers check along with the apartment keys in a drop box, when I completed my move on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, during my initial research of Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP, I located numerous, disparaging reviews, that are consistent with what appears to be unethical and mendacious practices. For example, on XXXX Illegal Collections Kimball Tirey St. John : XXXX : Reviews Kimball Tirey & St. John LLP Complaint : I checked my credit report Sunday evening seeing there was a new debt of almost {$3000.00} placed on. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, - Rip-off Report : Kimball, Tirey & St. John - After 9 years they forged documents and put garnishment on my wages. XXXX By obtaining a copy of my case file, several concerns are raised. For example, on one court document, there is a section which notes that the lease agreement I authorized with XXXX, was entered on XX/XX/XXXX. This date is incorrect. According to a recent letter issued to me by XXXX XXXX, the in-service date on record, is XX/XX/XXXX, whereas XXXX terminated service on Monday XX/XX/XXXX the day after I completed my move. 

Furthermore, according to XXXX XXXX ; a Commercial Real Estate Directs PDF newsletter ; Thursday XX/XX/XXXX ; The property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a XXXX investor group, in a deal brokered by the XXXX XXXX office of XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX. Therefore, raising a concern on whether Kimball as the debt collector ; has the right to collect this debt an behalf of XXXX ( via ) an Evidence of Assignment. 

In my efforts to challenge Kimballs claim, I had hoped to obtain copies of the Cashiers Check I submitted, along with a copy of the original lease and apartment payment history, etc, for example ; but not limited to ; I re-visited the XXXX XXXX location, and was informed the property is now under new management / ownership. XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, I was informed that XXXX has no alliance with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, nor do they have any business dealings with Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP. 

In addition, I was also informed that Kimball would have copies of the original lease, payment history etc. in their records, along with proof of an Evidence of Assignment, to substantiate their claim. Un-fortunately, when I contacted Kimball, Tirey & St. John to inquire of these documents, I was told by their representative We dont have to show you anything as he ended our conversation by disconnecting the call. 

However, around XX/XX/XXXX : nine-years and two months later after my move in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Memorandum of Costs after Judgement Acknowledgement of Credit and Declaration of Accrued Interest, along with a Notice of Change of Address or Other Contact Information from Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP which was mailed to my current address. 

In the interim, around XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; a financial and insurance carrier I submit cases to as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, along with a copy of their reply to a wage garnishment request via XXXX XXXX Sheriffs Office, per the request of Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call, made to my office at XXXX XXXX, from a representative of Kimball, Tirey & St. John, demanding that I make payments toward the judgement against me or else. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received in my mail a wage garnishment order via XXXX Sheriffs Department, per the request of Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP. 

In my opinion, there appears to be a consistent pattern of untimely denigrations exhibited by representatives of Kimball , Tirey & St. John, which in my opinion, is a law firm /collection agency that is financially motivated to perform their task through any means necessary. For example : regarding my case : The Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, presented to the court by Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP, ( aka ) as Exhibit I ; this document which is dated XX/XX/XXXX in the upper right-hand corner, is not formatted on XXXX letter head, appears to have been re-created, as it shows the covering up of information, while utilizing paper that is initially dated ; XX/XX/XXXX with a fax time stamp of:XXXX,  p.2, located in the footer ; of Exhibit I. 

In my opinion, for the representative of this law firm, to present this document in a court of law, to a highly regarded judge - court appointee, as a blatant act of deception and dis-regard for our judicial system and the very laws they are sworn to uphold and defend and raising the question of Extrinsic or Intrinsic Fraud ( via ) Fabrication of Evidence by an Attorney. 

I am seeking your assistance in investigating this firms suspicious practices. I am confident that there are other incidents ; past and present that are comparable and closely similar. Thank you, for taking time out of your busy schedule to address my inquiry.

I was approved for a short sale program and received two letters dated  XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in which I have enclosed. These letters state while I am selling my property short sale it is not necessary or required to make payments. The short sale is ongoing and my home is to be sold as is. Hurricane Irma arrives in Florida on XX/XX/XXXX and my mobile home sustained damages of $ XXXX..I contacted my insurance company and made a claim. An insurance check was cut for allegedly {$7200.00} and sent to my mortgage company instead of me. I contacted the insurance company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on several occasions inquiring on the whereabouts of the check. Per the insurance company the mortgage company demanded that the insurance check be sent to my mortgage company servicer Select Portfolio Servicing ( known as SPS ). I don't know why this occurred. The insurance check should have been sent to me the borrower since I am being charged monthly for this insurance. I have enclosed documentation whereas the insurance is included in my mortgage payments. I contacted SPS and they claim the check was mailed to me. I never received a check. Then I got these three letters attached dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX disclosing as a condition of cashing the insurance claim check I agreed to complete the repairs and to request an inspection. I never received an insurance check. The check went to SPS as per the insurance company disclosed. Consequently I have lived in this mobile home in deplorable conditions over one year and the repairs still have not been made. The buyers who I sold the home to "" as is "" still signed a contact to purchase the mobile home and 5 acres even after the hurricane and with all the damages. To this day I never received the insurance check due to the mortgage company has not sent it to me nor the insurance company. I am being charged for these insurance premiums monthly. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from my mortgage company SPS disclosing that they approved my short sale ; please see attached letter. I was elated that the short sale was approved and so was my buyers. We were all excited and I began moving. The buyers began preparing to move into the mobile home. However on XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from SPS disclosing the approval letter was sent incorrectly because now the short sale offer was denied by the investor. I am confused an angry with this entire situation. I was current on my loan payments but was told by the mortgage company since I agreed to the short sale not to make any more payments. My credit is awful now and I eventually had to sign a deed in lieu in order to save myself. I never received the insurance check in over a year ; allegedly the check went to my mortgage company when I was the one being charged for the insurance. The short sale was approved as documentation shows yet rescinded since the offer was denied by the investor.I feel betrayed by my mortgage company in so many ways. I even tried to obtain a modification with SPS however the terms and length of the mortgage was outrageous. Please any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Going forward equifax should be required to monitor every account and notify victims if any fraud occurs. Credit fraud protection should be mandatory for every account, not an option for us to have deal with.

About 2 years ago, after Navient had become the servicer of these loans, when the loans came out of deferment and I began making payments for all I applied and received approval for an income based repayment plan which also included a 10 year debt forgiveness component because I am working for a XXXX XXXX. I setup monthly automatic payments to be taken out of my checking account. These payments came put monthly without any problem for a good amount of time, I would estimate a year or more. Strangely, without any notice from Navient, and with no indication that it had do to with any issue from my bank, these automatic payments which were setup through navient simply STOPPED. I did not know they had stopped, I did not receive any word that my payments were not being collected, not even any warnings. They have simply stopped collected payments from me. While on my end, in the short term this seemed like a good thing because no one was asking me to pay, in the big picture this hurts me because I believe that it sets back the 10 year timeline of debt forgiveness that by now I should be 2 or 3 years into, through no fault of my own, and through Navients failure to even tell me that I was not paying them. In the business of my schedule as a XXXX   and a father, I have only tried once to find out why the auto payments stopped and to reinstate these payments, but I was not able to get a solution. I am going to make another attempt. But I can't help but wondering if this is related to the larger issues I am seeing in which Navient has received serious allegations for innapropriately handling their business.

Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Section 809 ( b ), Validating Debts : If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. 
( emphasis added ) I respectfully request that you provide me with the following : 1. the amount of the debt ; 2. the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; 3. verification or copy of any judgment ( if applicable ) ; 4. proof that you are licensed to collect debts in Maine ; 5. proof of the last payment made on the account. 
I am asserting my rights under the federal and state Fair Debt Collection Practices Acts and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including these rights : Because I have disputed this debt in writing within 30 days of receipt of your initial notice, you must obtain verification of the debt or a copy of the judgment against me and mail these items to me at your expense. 
You can not add interest or fees except those allowed by the original contract or state law. 
Any attempt to collect this debt without validating it violates the FDCPA. 
Also be advised that I am keeping accurate records of all correspondence from you and your company, including recording all phone calls, and I will not hesitate to report violations of the law to my State Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission and the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I have disputed this debt. Therefore, until it is validated, your information concerning this debt is assumed to be inaccurate. Accordingly, if you have already reported this debt to any credit-reporting agency ( CRA ) or Credit Bureau ( CB ), then you must immediately inform them of my dispute with this debt. 
Reporting information that you know to be inaccurate or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act 1681s-2. Should you pursue a judgment without validating this debt, I will inform the judge and request that the case be dismissed based on your failure to comply with the FDCPA. 
Finally, if you do not own this debt, I demand that you immediately send a copy of this dispute letter to the original creditor so they are also aware that I dispute the debt.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NC,282XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3451684

I owed XXXX dollars this morning I woke up to find my car had been repossessed. I called Santander ( my loan company ) to see if I could make my payment of the full amount dude to get my car back and they refused to reinstate my loan after repossession due to failure to maintain timely payments. When it was partially their fault I was behind on my payments in the first place seeing as they never sent me any bills via certified mail. I take responsibility on my part because I should have been more diligent in finding out how much I owe and when payments were due. But I have always paid my bills via certified mail. They refuse to help me in anyway they keep telling me its company policy to not reinstate my vehicle even if I pay the current amount due in total they say they only way they will surrender the car back to me is I pay the loan off in full. I never received a written letter ( notice ) via certified mail notifying me that my car was in default and due for repossession. I live in XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX states in order for the lean company to reposesss your vehicle they must send you a written letter 10 days prior to repossession with the current amount due to give you a chance to pay the amount and keep your car. The company admitted to not sending me this letter stating that va law does not require this and they can come get it when they want.

After 10 days, I finally received a verification code. I entered it on the Equifax website and then was directed to enter my password. I entered my password then was prompted that I could not access my account until I changed my password. I changed my password then was prompted that I could not access my account at that time and to callk XXXX. I called that number.

In XX/XX/XXXX, Valarity XXXX LLC reported these XXXX bills as negative and outstanding collection accounts and I called and spoke with XXXX at Valarity ( repeatedly ) to have these removed from my account. I also spoke with XXXX XXXX at XXXX to confirm that I did n't owe these bills beginning of XXXX, and she said that they should be removed from my XXXX Credit Report and then had XXXX Hospital email Valarity , LLC explaining that these are not bills I owe and should be deleted. Valarity told me then that they were disputing these accounts with XXXX and I also submitted a dispute with XXXX myself. Within 3 days, XXXX of the XXXX accounts were deleted. I waited 10 days and called XXXX to look into another investigation on why the other XXXX were not being deleted and then I waited the recommended 45 day time period with XXXX while calling Valarity again to see why XXXX accounts came back as verified as true debt. At this point, I spoke with XXXX, a supervisor with Valarity , LLC frequently and she was supposed to be helping me get these accounts deleted. I submitted another dispute with XXXX and XXXX of the XXXX accounts were deleted within a week, but the final XXXX were again verified as true debt, only this time they were listed as "" true debt collection, paid in full '' on my credit report causing a drop in my credit score! I called XXXX weekly, sometimes a XXXX times a week to get this matter resolved. She sent me out a letter from Valarity explaining I did n't owe the debt and said it might take up to XXXX XXXX for these last XXXX to be removed ( even though I reminded her that she and XXXX had both said if I never owed these debts that they would by law have to be removed immediately from my report and would take 24 hours to be deleted. ) I began a XXXX investigation with XXXX while it was still in the dispute process with them to have someone look into what was going on. XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX again to inquire why these XXXX debts were listed as closed and the status on my credit report had now listed these as paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for the other and these accounts now said true collection of debt. XXXX told me XXXX XXXX, that her manager would be calling me back right away to help me with this and took my number. No one called me.

As a result, I was charged interest when I submitted payment for what I thought was my statement balance, but was in fact the minimum amount due under the program. 
When I reviewed my next account statement, I noted an interest charge and considered it a mistake on my part for not paying off the full balance. I submitted a payment to cover the full statement balance so that I would no longer be charged interest. 
My current statement now shows another interest charge. I called American Express on XXXX XXXX XXXX and their customer service representative ( XXXX ) advised that even though I had submitted payment in full for my statement balance, the company was going to continue to charge me interest for the previous charges. In effect, these charges are perpetual -- paying off my full balance would only cover the interest calculated for the reported balance, but interest continues to accrue after the statement is delivered and even after they receive payment.

A-part one of this new Complaint : It is my right to respond to the above Wells Fargo bank unfounded claims.

1-I never complained to the CFPB about any account ending in XXXX  that Wells Fargo claimed to be an account opened on my name and social security. If it existed then Wells Fargo bank just committed fraud against me and it should be severe more legal consequences to be assumed by this bank.

2- I never made any fraud claim with Wells Fargo for the amounts claimed by this bank as they stated above.

3- without my consent, Wells Fargo bank closed my personal credit account in retaliation and violation of the consumer Protection Act and in violation of OSHA Act Section 11 ( c ) the full account number of my impacted account is XXXX.

thus if Wells Fargo can not prove by clear convincing evidences the opposite of each of all my above response statements then Wells Fargo contend to the violations it committed.

B- Second part of this new complaint : Wells Fargo bank in its Retaliatory new inventions had repeatedly mailing letters from its consumer collection department.

On Friday XX/XX/2019 I called Wells Fargo collection departments and they confirmed to me that I do not owe Wells Fargo anything to be collected from those above collection department at Wells Fargo bank. Therefore, Wells Fargo bank is harassing me, embarrassing me, invading my privacy, forcing me into a state of constant fear. All that I believed Wells Fargo is doing against me to silence me from speaking up about its violations against me or consumers rights.

Wells Fargo deprived me from a source I use to buy vital necessities, Wells Fargo blacklisted against me, now Wells Fargo closing my personal account and sending me letters from collections. If I loose the place I am renting now. Wells Fargo then forcing me to hanger strike and Wells Fargo bank decision makers should be fully criminally legally responsible for that and/or for any harm of any kind to my well being or safety or life.

Wells Fargo assume full legal consequences for its retaliatory actions against me.Wells Fargo assumes full legal and/or criminal liabilities for anything negative that happened or to happen to the complainant. Wells Fargo bank assumes all the legal consequences for its continuous retaliatory adverse actions it committed against XXXX XXXX. This complaint is in defense and response to new alleged claims by Wells Fargo against the rights of XXXX XXXX as cited. All stated herein is to the complainant current states belief, knowledge and understanding and it is all subject to any change or correction of any kind by him only at any time without any notice and without waiving his rights.

84202,2019-05-06,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Hello, Approx. 11 years ago, I purchased a home as a first time home buyer. Shortly thereafter, the value of the property dropped well below what was owed on the mortgage. The mortgage is currently with Mr. Cooper/XXXX  XXXX. I continued to pay the mortgage as per my agreed upon contract. However, approx. 5-6 years ago, there was a hardship and reduced income. At that time, the mortgage was current and remains current to this day but I took advantage of the government HAMP modification program to attempt to make this more affordable with my reduced income. I also worked in other ways to reduce my expenses. At the time, I was advised that if I continued to pay on the mortgage per the modified terms that every year I would receive {$1000.00} principal forgiveness. This forgiveness was never applied to my mortgage balance so I called Mr. Cooper/XXXX  earlier this year to address this. When contacting Mr. Cooper, I was originally told that yes, I should have been receiving this forgiveness every year on the anniversary of the approval if the account remained in good standing, which it has. I was told that the research department would look into why I didn't receive the forgiveness. Eventually, I received a response that stated I did not qualify for forgiveness of principal as my monthly housing expenses did not decline enough with the modification. I had never been presented with this stipulation and it was on no paperwork that I signed. I have requested Mr. Cooper send me documentation to verify this stipulation but they have stopped responding. I feel as though I was a victim of a bait and switch by a large mortgage company that feels they can get away with whatever they want. I feel cheated. I work hard and pay all my bills on time and was offered help only to have the rug pulled out from under me. I don't understand why I was told for years that I would receive principal forgiveness but when it comes due, they won't apply it and won't provide me with any paperwork regarding this. It seems as though they are making it up as they go. I have done everything in my power to pay this debt on time and when I get close to being above water, I am done a disservice by the mortgage company and this greatly impacts my living situation.",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,WI,532XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-06,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3233973

The end of XX/XX/XXXX, I called the credit card company to verify if I was eligible for a credit card promotion. You receive XXXX XXXX air miles points if you spend {$3000.00} dollars within the first 3 months of opening a new card. You are not eligible if you open or close a card within the last 24 months, hence the reason I called customer service to verify if I was eligible. I had made this mistake 2 years prior, when they changed the policy from an 18 month to a 24 month waiting period to qualify without my knowledge. I didn't receive the XXXX bonus miles, although I spent the required XXXX dollars. I try to learn from my mistakes so I wanted to make sure I qualified this time and that I indeed had gone past the two year waiting period. The woman at Citibank 's customer service office confirmed that I had, so I applied for a new card which I received in the beginning of XXXX. 
By the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I had spent the required XXXX XXXX dollars. I checked my account and noticed the XXXX points had not been posted to my airline miles account with XXXX XXXX. I called to find out why and was told I wasn't getting XXXX points because the customer service person I spoke to in XXXX had apparently made a mistake. I was shocked. I feel like I have been duped into spending a lot of money for nothing. I asked to speak to a supervisor and then a manager both times told it's unfortunate but they can't do anything to rectify the situation. I demanded to speak to someone else and they said they would have another higher up manager call me from the review department. That was supposed to be within 24-48 hours. They never called. 
I do not feel I should be paying for their mistake, especially when I made sure this time I was doing everything correctly and was told I qualified. If I had been told the correct information I simply would have waited until I was qualified to open a new card. I was denied that option with the wrong information. Now I have to wait another 2 years ( a total of 4 ) to qualify for a new bonus program. We are talking about points not currency.

1574224,2018-10-10,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,"Excess mileage, damage, or wear fees, or other problem after the lease is finish","XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To whom it may concern : I am writing to complain about the service I have received from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX  ). In XXXX, I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from the above mentioned company. The Vehicle was returned to XXXX XXXX, located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, since the lease was ending on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a statement with a balance of {$790.00} due by XX/XX/XXXX .The statement shows the following breakdown : {$390.00} Disposition fee, which I was aware of and have already succesfully processed the payment. 
{$400.00} for Excess Wear and Use. 
On XX/XX/XXXX when I have returned the vehicle, I was assisted by XXXX, the only representative at the "" Lease-End '' department in XXXX XXXX XXXX location. I was never offered a day or a time for the inspection prior to the vehicle return by her. I was advised only to drop off the vehicle at the location mentioned above and that she will assist me with the rest of the process. Per XXXX 's initial inspection the vehicle was in a good condition, she stated there should not be any additional charges besides the disposition fee of {$390.00}. Upon receiving the statement I called the XXXX Quality Control Department on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to representative named XXXX, who was very unprofessional in handling my complaint, he was rude and sarcastic. All he said, was if I do not agree with the statement and if I do not believe I caused any damages to the car, I need to transfer the balance to anyone I believe is responsible for it, which did not make any sense to me. He also stated that XXXX 's job is to bill clients, and not to assist with such an issue. After that I have explained him that I have taken pictures of the vehicle at the dealership parking lot on the day of the return ( please see attached pictures below ) and that pictures clearly indicate no damages of any kind. Only after that he advised me to go into XXXX XXXX XXXX enter the vehicle VIN number ( XXXX ) and the account number ( XXXX ) to check pictures of the inspected vehicle and the inspection report, that shows 3 different types of damages which are : 1. LF Carpet Burn Hole 1/8 '' to 1/2 '' 2. LT Rocker Panel Outer Dent/No Paint Dmg 3 '' to 4 '' 3. RF Wheel Curb Rash 7 '' to 8 '' After that I advised XXXX, that I do not recognize none of the damages and they clearly contradict with pictures I have taken on XX/XX/XXXX ( day of the return ). 
The website pictures were uploaded on the day of inspection XX/XX/XXXX, which is 8 days after I have returned the vehicle. He only suggested to contact the dealership directly, since he could not assist me any further, He also mentioned that the dealership should be held responsible, since the vehicle was in their posession for that period of 8 days from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Following his advise I called the dealership, and was transferred again to XXXX. XXXX has told me that the dealership can not help me with anything since they do not have the vehicle in their possession anymore, and I need to call the inspection company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) The representative at XXXX XXXX XXXX has transferred me back to XXXX, stating that the owner of the vehicle and the company that is sending out the statement is XXXX and I need to deal with them. I have been dealing with this issue since then. Noone is willing to give me any explanation of : 1. why the vehicle was not thoroughly inspected on the day of return XX/XX/XXXX and I was not issued a copy of the inspection report? 
2. why was the vehicle inspected 8 days after it was returned? 
3. why I was never offered an option to be present at the time of the inspection ( even though it was conducted 8 days after the return )? 
4. who is responsible for the vehicle after it has been returned. 
None of the above mentioned companies are willing to assist me with the issue I am facing. XXXX representatives are not willing to assist me in any way, however, they have sent me another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX, notifying me that if I do not make a payment of {$790.00}, ( {$390.00} of which has been already paid ) they will utilize a collection agency to collect the payment. Since none of the above mentioned company representatives are willing to communicate to each other or get on a conference call to clear the issue, it makes it impossible for me to resolve the problem I am facing. Realizing that this may damage my credit history as well, I seek for your help. If I do not get help from XXXX and resolve this issue quickly, I will have no choice but to seek the help of an attorney to go after all parties that are involved in this mess, that caused me so much emotional distress and can possibly damage my credit. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",,HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA,CA,912XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2018-10-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3041710

37031,2019-03-27,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Other personal consumer report,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"i, woman XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) of flesh  and blood am not a corporation nor business but a human being. My theft/loss of equipment on XX/XX/XXXX was for personal use only. After my theft/loss I contacted and reported it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX informed me that I would need to provide an inventory list and any other information I had on my stolen equipment. On XX/XX/XXXX I provided an inventory list with pictures and serial numbers. I then contacted a friend of mine ( XXXX ) and told him of my loss and asked for his assistance/advice in purchasing equipment. Studio equipment is complex in setting it up and usually takes the assistance of an electrical engineer in the set up. I am not an electrical engineer or a professional with studio equipment, so I asked him to help me pick out equipment that would be easy to assemble as well as discounted. The less money I could spend the better. In the first letter mailed to USAA titled, NOTICE : OF HARRASMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA paragraph seven I informed USAA that I have people helping me set up things through tech support and that they are professionals not me ( see attached document ). I also requested that all equipment be mailed to his house since I had just been robbed and I work 13-hour days, I did not want to take the chance of my equipment being taken again. XXXX agreed to assist me with the purchasing of the equipment. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a document stating that I would receive a payment of {$7600.00}. I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX where he explained that the total amount for the settlement was {$10000.00} but {$2900.00} was taken for Recoverable Depreciation and that I would get the remainder of the money when I provided receipts of purchasing my equipment. This is the first time that Recoverable Depreciation  was brought to my attention. In the document sent to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 4 USAA states Policy language allows the insured to collect RD as replacements are completed. What policy language? What does policy language mean? i am not a business or corporation nor am I an insurance company. Policy language is a foreign concept to me. Pages 8 through 9 of the RENTERS POLICY USAA provides a list of definition, why did USAA chose to not include recoverable depreciation in the list of definitions? Why did USAA only provide a definition to recoverable depreciation after a policy holders ( me ) loss and after the first payment? Since XXXX was the one purchasing equipment for me through his account so that I could get the discounts offered to him I asked him to contact XXXX and asked them to put my name on the receipt. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX two payments through XXXX. However, we ran into some difficulties when XXXX would not release the funds. XXXX had told me that XXXX stated that the funds had not been released I then informed XXXX that this information was not true and the money had already been taken out of my account. XXXX also stated that XXXX told him that payment for equipment was noted in the transaction, a note that I did not provide. That the money would not be released until he gave me the equipment. If USAA bank removed the money from my account but did not give it to XXXX until they could verify that i got my equipment. Then how did XXXX XXXX know that the money was meant to be used for purchasing my equipment when USAA bank and XXXX XXXX are two different corporations under two different CEOs? Currently the issue is still being looked at. With that in mind the continuation of payment for the remaining balance is to be submitted by me to XXXX by cash or check. I require USAA to show me where in the original policy titled RENTERS POLICY PACKET does it state that I am not allowed to have assistance in the purchasing of my loss? XXXX provided me with one receipt from XXXX totaling {$14000.00} that I then submitted to USAA on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached document ). In the document that USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 5 USAA claims that I submitted two receipts totaling {$16000.00}. This is false, I submitted one receipt totaling {$14000.00} from XXXX. Where did USAA get the second receipt from? Who submitted a second receipt with the use of my information? I require USAA to submit to me the second receipt totaling {$2300.00} in which USAA states they received from me. I also request documentation of how the second receipt was submitted. On XX/XX/XXXX USAA sent me a document that a payment of {$1600.00} would be posted on my account. I then called USAA and asked why I was only receiving {$1600.00} instead of the remaining {$2900.00}. The USAA employee told me that an investigation would be submitted to the claims department for the remainder of my money. In the document USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 5 USAA claims a referral was submitted as our RD claim review yielded the following. An invoice provided by XXXX XXXX was purchased under a business name, subsequent to her confirming the XXXX stolen for her personal use only. This is misleading information for I was the one who asked for an investigation because I was only given {$1600.00} instead of {$2900.00}. The Special Investigation Unit was not contacted due to my receipt being under a business name for if that were the truth the payment of {$1600.00} would have never been given. The Special Investigation Unit only became involved when I requested for further investigation. Why would I submit a request for investigation if I am misrepresenting myself? Why did USAA release the amount of {$1600.00} in the first place if I was misrepresenting my use of equipment? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that the payment of {$1600.00} was cancelled. I once again called USAA and asked why the money was being taken back, the USAA employee stated that it was due to the claim being under investigation. I found it strange that they would take the money back, because I was the one who asked for the investigation. I then asked the employee if i would receive my full amount after the investigation is done in which she replied yes. This cancellation of payment put me behind on my payments to XXXX. Lucky for me XXXX is a fair and understanding man, him and I created a payment plan where I could finish paying out the rest of the equipment. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call in which the document titled NOTICE : OF HARASSMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA speaks of ( see attached document ) I was asked an abundance of personal and inappropriate questions during this conversation. The document USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 7 USAA states The allegation XXXX XXXX was asked inappropriate questions was also unfounded, how is asking me if I know anyone who wants to cause me harm an appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? How does this help your investigation on why I did not receive full payment? How is asking me if I had deliveries made to my home during the time frame of the theft and appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? How is asking me who comes into my home, an appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? How is asking me why I did not contact management of my apartment complex or contact neighbors and investigate on my own the loss of my equipment and appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? When I did not want to answer a question USAA would ask me if there was a reason I did not want to answer the question making the list of questions and interrogation, how is it appropriate for an insurance company to interrogate its policy holders and victims? I require USAA to provide me with documentation stating that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is also a detective agency in which USAA is allowed to conduct a further investigation without the police. 
In the document sent to Nevada Division of Insurance  paragraph 6 USAA states On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX provided a recorded statement to the SIU Investigator and confirmed her new artist name was used to purchase the XXXX. This is false, in the conversation of XX/XX/XXXX I was asked who XXXX was? In which I responded that it was my XXXX name. I did not state that my XXXX name was used to purchase the equipment and even if it was, my XXXX name is nothing more than a second identity it is not a business or corporation and I stated that in the conversation as well as in writing ( see NOTICE : OF HARASSMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA XXXX. I require USAA to provide me with the documentation as well as a copy of the recording from that conversation where I state that I am a business/corporation. 
The SIU investigator also asked me if i were to get my equipment back would i let USAA know? I responded by asking why would i have to let USAA know? She states that it is because USAA has a financial investment in the loss. What financial investment? How does USAA have a financial investment in my loss? How does USAA have a financial investment in my equipment? How does USAA have a financial investment in my money and name? Furthermore, where doe USAA get the funds to pay me? Where is that money now since USAA took it out of my private and personal banking account? Who did USAA pay the money too? was it XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX? Where does the remainder of my money go if USAA does not give it to me? I require USAA to send me the original recording of the XX/XX/XXXX phone conversation. 
Towards the end of that conversation I asked the SIU investigator why I was being asked all these questions she responded that is was due to the name XXXX being on the receipt. Again, I was confused what does my XXXX name also being on the receipt have to do with anything. This statement was the closest explanation that I have received from USAA as to why my money was taken from me, and it was not even an explanation they simply said because the name XXXX was included in the receipt. In the document submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance  from USAA paragraph 7 USAA states XXXX XXXX allegations she was given monies and it taken back without explanation is unfounded we told XXXX XXXX the reasoning of the EFT reversal of her RD payments. This is false, in fact if it were not for Nevada Division of Insurance I would still not know that USAA took my money because USAA came to a conclusion that I was using my equipment for business and not personal. I require that USAA send me the documentation in which they explained to me that the money in the amount of {$1600.00} was taken from my account due to a misrepresentation of use of equipment. I also require that USAA provide me with proof that I received that document. 
After I submitted NOTICE : OF HARASSMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA to USAA XXXX XXXX contacted me. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX requested that I provided proof of payment and my XXXX and XXXX taxes. I of free will provided XXXX XXXX with my XXXX but did not understand why I needed to provide proof of payment when I had already provided it. When I told XXXX XXXX that I already provided proof of payment she responded with We have the receipt for the replacement of equipment, but need your proof of payment for that equipment. ( see attached document ) This response made no sense to me because in that same document sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM AND DEMAND FOR PAYMENT under point 1 it states Proof of purchase and/or proof of payment for your stolen items. This can include, but is not limited to receipt, invoice, .. I provided them with what their document states counts as proof of payment so What exactly was USAA asking for? On the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT page 2 section d I asked USAA why is it that they needed more information from me when I provided them with the receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. USAA did not respond. Why did USAA not respond? 
In the document submitted by USAA to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 6 USAA states On XX/XX/XXXX, the SIU Investigator requested all proof of payment for the XXXX replacements, and tax returned from XXXX XXXX. Subsequently, she provided her XXXX tax returns to SIU Investigator for further evaluation As stated earlier I willingly provided my XXXX tax return to USAA, so that they could see that I do not make money from my music. That it is nothing more than therapeutic release. 
The response to receiving my XXXX taxes was to submit my XXXX tax returns. I then submitted in writing to USAA that I would not be providing them with anymore private information under the Privacy Act of XXXX. Every time I was compliant USAA would ask me for more private information. Due to my mental health illness I did not work in XXXX, I sustained myself with my basic housing allowance provided to me by my Post XXXX XXXX XXXX and my XXXX check both of which are nontaxable. Hence, I had no tax returns to provide. In the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT page 2 section d I requested USAA to provide me with a valid reason for needing this information, USAA did not reply. Why did USAA not reply to me? How did USAA determine that oracle was correlated to a business when my XXXX taxes clearly show that it does not? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT. This was sent by both mail and through the message board on my USAA claims account. In this document I provided USAA with FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND PRIVACY ACT REQUEST, where I requested the USAA provide me with all the information they had, USAA did not respond. I also provided in the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT proof of me, XXXX XXXX XXXX as a living being ( see document FOR THE CLAIMANTS- KNOWLEDGE OF THS LIVE-LIFE WITH THIS CLAIM BY THIS CLAIMANT ) to prove to USAA that i XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX am not a business or corporation but a human being in flesh and blood. I also stated in the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT page 2 second to last paragraph that I would not be providing USAA with the information of private citizens. 
In the XX/XX/XXXX phone call the SIU investigator asked me if I was working with someone. I stated no, and I stand by that response. I was not and am not working with anyone. I have people who help me which I explained earlier but I do not work with anyone. To work with someone means to get paid which I have stated several times throughout the months that I do not get paid for my music, to receive help is voluntary. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a document through USAA message board titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM stating that On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and Pro Audio and they advised that the receipt that you submitted was not a legitimate receipt and the order number does not match the document you submitted to XXXX XXXX. They also stated that their letterhead was incorrect on the invoice and located a quote that matched your invoice that was given to another person. Yet in the document submitted by USAA to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 6 USAA states The SIU investigation yielded the following ; the invoice in questions was not provided by the store listed on it. Hence, XXXX XXXX RD claim was denied for misrepresentation. Which one is it? Is USAA not paying me because the quote of my invoice was given to another person or is USAA not paying me because the invoice was not provided by the store listed on it? If the store wasn't the right store then where did USAA get the information that the invoice was given to another person? 
Furthermore, which receipt/invoice is USAA talking about? Are they referring to the one I submitted from XXXX which is where the equipment was purchased from or is USAA referencing the second receipt that I did not submit yet they somehow have? Also if the receipt was under another person or the invoice was not provided by the store listed than where did USAA come to the conclusion that i XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  am a business? Every equipment in that receipt is in my possession I have pictures as well as serial number that can be given at any time upon request but USAA has never requested for that information. I require USAA to submit to me the documentation in which XXXX   stated all of the above information. I require USAA to send me all documents in which they were able to create the conclusion that I was using my equipment for business use and not personal. 
In the document submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance from USAA Paragraph 4 USAA states Policy language allows the insured to collect RD as replacements are completed. As long as the actual amount incurred exceeds the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paid on the line item , RD can be released up to the estimated amount or the actual amount spent, whichever is less. This statement is false, in the document titled RENTERS POLICY PACKET page 20 first paragraph of loss settlement it states, We will pay the full cost of repair or replacement, subject to all policy provisions. No deduction will be made for depreciation. 
Why did USAA deduct depreciation from my settlement if the contract itself states that they will not? In that same document page 8 under definition of actual cash value it states actual cash value means the replacement cost of property at the time of loss less a deduction for depreciation based on its age and usage.. USAA contradicted itself within its own document by first stating that depreciation is taken from the actual cash value and then stating that depreciation will not be taken under loss settlement. Which one is it USAA? 
In the document submitted by USAA to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 7 USAA states Lastly, her assertion an illegal search and seizure was conducted and is unfounded, as we acted in accordance with the renters policy, specifically the Duties after Loss excerpt. Then USAA provided Nevada Division of Insurance with 10 out of the 50 page RENTERS POLICY PACKET and highlighted the Duties after Loss section. The Duties after Loss excerpt does not state what USAA is required/allowed to do but only states what I must do after my loss. How can the Duties After Loss excerpt be a form of defense against illegal search in seizure when this excerpt only pertains to what I must do within the policy? 
On the document titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM dated XX/XX/XXXX a letter also sent to Nevada Division of Insurance by USAA the first sentence under Factual Summary states On XX/XX/XXXX, you advised that your residence was broken into and your studio was robbed. I told USAA that my apartment was broken into and my studio equipment was stolen. Not that my studio was robbed. i do not have a studio i only have studio equipment. The document that USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 2 USAA states, XXXX XXXX reported that on XX/XX/XXXX her studio residence was burglarized. What studio residence? i don't even know what a studio residence is. 
What is a studio residency? Where did USAA get this idea that my studio residence was robbed or that my studio was robbed when the police report itself states that the robbery took place in my residence/home ( see attached document )? I provided a copy of my lease to show that i live in an apartment as well as the floor plans that my apartment complex rents out. To show that studio residence is not a space that is rented through them. Here is my property managers information XXXX XXXX in case USAA needs to verify that i am renting a one bedroom apartment. I require USAA to submit to me the document in which I state that I have a studio residence. 
Lastly, who is XXXX XXXX? The document from USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance was written by a XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is not XXXX XXXX XXXX who I have addressed in my documents. I have never spoken to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX has not contacted me. How can someone speak on behalf of USAA in a claim that they have nothing to do with? 
How can someone other than the President speak on behalf of USAA on a claim they have nothing to do with? Where did XXXX XXXX receive the information from? Did XXXX XXXX investigate the claim? Did XXXX XXXX listen to the voice recording? Did XXXX XXXX read the documents sent back and forth between USAA employees and myself? Did XXXX XXXX speak to XXXX? 
XXXX XXXX was not involved with this case until the documentation to Nevada Division of Insurance was submitted. Considering that XXXX XXXX provided no supporting documents to any of the conversation between USAA and I that is stated in the document it is safe to assume that all the information acquired is hearsay, which an insurance company is not allowed to do. 
I am the victim here, I was violated and robbed within my own home and then I was violated and robbed through my insurance company who under oath agreed to uphold the constitution in my protection. USAA has given me excuse after excuse for not paying me in full such as due to the hurricanes on the east coast they fell behind with their claims, because the name XXXX  was on the receipt, to lastly the receipt that I provided was false. I am not using the equipment for the business but for personal. I provided USAA with evidence that I do not make money from my music such as my tax return from XXXX. 
Then USAA stated that the receipt I provided was false and even then, USAA did not state that the equipment is not in my possession. USAA provided nothing more than a story to Nevada Division of Insurance, USAA provided no supporting documents to any of the conversations they claimed we had in which I admitted to being a corporation/business, USAA did not provide conversations submitted back and forth between USAA and I ( information that I have provided, see attached documents ), USAA withheld information from Nevada Division of Insurance, USAA provided fraudulent information to Nevada Division of Insurance, USAA attempted to defame my good name with Nevada Division of Insurance, and USAA provided misleading information to Nevada Division of Insurance. 
USAA created a corporation in my name XXXX XXXX XXXX without my consent or permission. And are now attempting to state that i created the corporation. It was not until the last document that USAA provided me and Nevada Division of Insurance titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM where they changed my name to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Why did USAA not change my name in the previous documents they submitted to me but changed it in the only document they submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance? Why did USAA only change my name when Nevada Division of Insurance became involved? Is this a part of the Cestui Que Trust? 
I demand that USAA provide me with every document I requested in this document as well as a response to all questions in writing within 10 days upon receipt. For verification and validation, I require a wet signature from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the response. Failure to answer all question, provide all documents, and a wet signature from XXXX XXXX XXXX by default will be an admission of guilt and wrongdoing. 
If USAA does not provide me with this information, I demand payment in full for the {$14000.00} minus the {$7600.00} already paid and the {$250.00} deductible totaling {$6500.00} to be sent to me by check through XXXX mail. I also demand USAA to cancel my renters policy insurance. For these are the causes of injury that must be cured. I also request that Nevada Division of Insurance fine USAA for the violation of codes listed on the attached document. This Claim/affidavit was submitted to [ XXXX ] XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX [ XXXX ] on XXXX XXXX and has yet to be resolved. 

I must reiterate that they USAA stated to me during a phone conversation with SUI investigator she stated that USAA had an investment in me and my property. Such is false and i demand to see all records that which at anytime USAA have tendered a bond or payments received from the US Treasury and or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in any amount paid out to USAA.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,NV,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3193394

1213786,2016-08-22,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"This is a follow-up complaint to an original complaint filed in XXXX and listed as case # XXXX. 

Upon submission of that complaint, U.S. Bank, the target of the complaint, replied back to the CFPB that the banks servicing agent, XXXX, was who the complaint should have been directed to, and after a phone from the CFPB to authorize the change to XXXX, I agreed with that new direction. 

However, I 've since received a letter ( attached ) from U.S. Bank that sheds new light on the ongoing fraud. 

In short, as part of that original complaint, U.S. Bank, as the successor trustee to XXXX XXXX XXXX, now admits that the Trust itself owns my Note and Mortgage, not the trustee, which is XXXX degrees contrary to the legal position that XXXX XXXX XXXX, and now by its role as successor trustee U.S. Bank took 11 years years ago to fraudulently file a Complaint in Foreclosure against my wife and I, and then to steadfastly defend the original lie through multiple court actions spanning more than a decade of legal disputes. 

It also contradicts the position that U.S. Bank 's own servicer recently stated in the attached letter. 

The core of the matter is that the original complaint that was filed by trustee XXXX Bank, which then was allegedly acquired by XXXX XXXX XXXX during the course of the litigation, stated in the court filings that it was the 'Owner and holder ' of the promissory Note involving my home loan, when we now know 11 years later that legal position was then and is now a complete and total fabrication in a fraudulent attempt to illegally foreclose on my house. 

While I admire U.S. Bank for finally admitting the ruse is up, the issue can not be swept under the rug, and the buck can not be passed to their servicer, XXXX 

Under the terms of the Consent Decree with the Comptroller of the Currency that that U.S. Bank signed in XXXX, the bank was required to take certain steps to ensure, among other stipulations, that under Article IV of the Decree, the bank must have : ( b ) processes to ensure that all factual assertions made in pleadings, declarations, affidavits, or other sworn statements filed by or on behalf of the Bank are accurate, complete, and reliable ; and that affidavits and declarations are based on personal knowledge or a review of the Bank 's books and records when the affidavit or declaration so states ; ( d ) processes to review and approve standardized affidavits and declarations for each jurisdiction in which the Bank files foreclosure actions to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and court procedures ; ( e ) processes to ensure that the Bank has properly documented ownership of the promissory note and mortgage ( or deed of trust ) under applicable state law, or is otherwise a proper party to the action ( as a result of agency or other similar status ) at all stages of foreclosure and bankruptcy litigation, including appropriate transfer and delivery of endorsed notes and assigned mortgages or deeds of trust at the formation of a residential mortgage-backed security, and lawful and verifiable endorsement and successive assignment of the note and mortgage or deed of trust to reflect all changes of ownership ; However, its now clear based on the attached letter from U.S. Bank that at the time it filed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX an 'Alias Praecipe ' for sale authorizing XXXX XXXX Sheriff to sell my home at a sheriff 's sale, that the bank knew or should have known that the ownership of the note and mortgage was not alignment with the original summary judgment in foreclosure ( see attached ), and the Affidavit was not made with personal knowledge ( attached ) since it named my wife on the Note even though she 's not, and as a result, should not have submitted the Praecipe to XXXX XXXX Court since that very act constitutes a breach of the Consent Decree, violates Federal law, and is prima facie evidence of fraud upon the court.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,OH,444XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-08-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2074012

I have been a Chase credit card holder for at least 20 years. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, while on the way to church, I told my daughter that one of my credit cards was missing. I always keep them in the same place in my wallet, and my Chase Marriott card was missing. Several days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, after searching for and not finding my card, I called Chase to cancel it, and was told there was a balance of {$860.00} on my account. I told them I had not been using that card and they told me the charges were made on XX/XX/XXXX at two local grocery stores in the amount of {$730.00}, and {$130.00}. I immediately told them the charges were fraudulent and they cancelled that card and sent me a replacement card ending in XXXX. My assisted living then contacted the police and I filed a police theft report on XX/XX/XXXX. It is assumed that one of the assisted living staff members stole the card out of my purse and utilized it twice on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since that time, I have been communicating with Chase at least monthly, yet they have denied my fraud claim multiple times and have even drastically lowered my available credit on my Chase United Card from {$25000.00} down to {$1400.00} due to non-payment and delinquency of the Marriot card. Chase continues to add late fees and interest to the account and after 11 months of communicating with Chase, the current balance is now at {$980.00}. 

This is a list of the dates that I have documented calls to Chase regarding these charges : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX Additionally, I mailed the police report to Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX DE XXXX.

I also had a local Chase Branch fax the police report to Chase Fraud Dept on XX/XX/XXXX using fax # XXXX XXXX XXXX. Today Chase Fraud stated they never got the report. 
Today, after finding out that the Fraud Dept STILL did not have my police report, the local Chase XXXX scanned and e-mailed it once more to the Fraud Dept. 
This accounts for at least 14 calls, one direct mailing, one fax and one scan and still my Fraud Case is  being denied. I am a throat XXXX survivor and each time I call Chase agents can not hear or understand me, and I need to repeat the same information over and over again. 

What concerns me most is that Chase failed to follow the Federal Fair Credit Billing Act has ruined my credit. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase stating that my line of credit on my Chase United card was decreased from {$25000.00} to {$1400.00} due to delinquency on accounts. Subsequently, my  auto ship medications were denied due to unavailable credit and I could not use my credit card to purchase medical supplies I need daily. On XX/XX/XXXX I had to have my daughter assist me with a credit review with Chase which took over 1 hour on the phone. XXXX then raised my line of credit to {$4000.00}, which is barely enough to sustain my monthly needs.

I contacted the bank by phone in an effort to resolve the issue. I was informed that my account had been forcefully closed ( without my consent ), that my funds would be temporarily seized ( unable to be withdrawn in person ), and that nothing could be said other than that it had been determined that my account posed a threat to the bank, and was shut down ( I had not received any notice prior to this moment - by email, mail/post, or voice mail - that my account was being suspected of fraudulent activity, or was at risk of being closed on negative terms by J.P. Morgan CHASE bank. ) I was told that after a period of time, where all my transactions had essentially flat-lined, I would receive a check for my balance in the mail. This was my sole account and therefore had the entirety of my personal funds tied up in it. I did not use the debit card associated with my account from then on, exceeding the time period I was given over the phone for no transactions, in an attempt to receive the money I desperately needed as soon as possible. However, during this period, the educational institution I was a student at during the time was able to directly-deposit an amount for scholarship into my CHASE account that was supposedly "" closed. '' I again made an effort to resolve the issue, and after talking to multiple people was finally able to go and collect my scholarship money, and the remainder of my account 's balance, from a nearby CHASE branch in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I had no desire to inquire as to the bank 's decision in closing my account as I had already made many attempts to do so with no definitive answers ( nobody once verbalized in our conversations any "" suspicion of fraudulent activity '' ) and I had been subjected to minor grievances prior with the institution. Later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to open an account with a local credit union. The credit union denied my application because of a credit report they received from Chexsystems in which there was stated : "" Suspected Fraud Activity - J.P. Morgan Chase. '' Immediately following this, my brother and I drove to a local branch and talked with an assistant manager. This individual, like everyone else I had talked with prior ( via phone and in person ) could not tell me anything regarding the nature of my account 's closure, nor the "" suspected fraud activity '' note that had prevented me from becoming a member at another financial institution. Although this individual did get back to me, no questions were answered, and the issue was not resolved in any way. Next, I attempted to called corporate but after two hours of explaining the same story repeatedly, and being put on hold for extensive periods of time, I finally spoke with an individual who told me that I would not be resolving the issue in the manner I wished. As I 'd expressed clearly throughout the entirety of my 120-minute phone call with J.P. Morgan CHASE Bank, my only goal was to attempt to strike this from the record as 1 ) I was essentially being wrongfully accused of fraud activity - I had not knowingly committed any, and 2 ) I was not notified in any way that my account was at risk for any reason whatsoever. I left the issue there, having been preoccupied with a cross-country move for a position I had been hired on for at XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. However, the problem was still of much concern to me, as I was gravely worried that during my FBI background investigation, this would pose a serious threat to my employment ( in the area of credit ). Later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was again denied an account at a local credit union for this same reason that I was denied previously back in XXXX.

Midland answered back with a motion for summary judgment. Midland ignored my letter electing arbitration per XXXX cardholder 's agreement. Midland forced me into litigation when a clause in XXXX 's cardholder agreement protects any alleged consumer from litigation. 

MY QUESTION TO MIDLAND FUNDING IS THIS : Why did you drag me into litigation when I invoked arbitration from day one? You ignored me. You denied my due process. 

CURRENT SITUATION : I was unlucky enough to get a superior court judge that does n't know arbitration laws and he gave Midland a summary judgment against me. I fought the litigation as much as possible, but the irony is that the arbitration clause protected me from litigation and yet Midland kept dragging me through it. 

Now there is a summary judgment that I am appealing to the Court of Appeals, who I hope knows the arbitration laws.

Certainly we were aware there was going to be monetary consequences for breaking a lease, but in excess of {$6700.00} is unbelievable! I have disputed the charges ( EX : $ 1100+ fee for carpets where there were NO pets and we lived in the unit for less than 12 months ) and attempted to work out a settlement option for a reduced, reasonable, and affordable amount using our tax refund and every time I was told they do NOT do settlements and I can just pay what I can towards the balance until it is paid in full. 

Recently, I decided to dispute the account with the credit bureaus regarding these erroneous and inflated charges in efforts to resolve this and on TrXXXX it indicates the account is now closed ( which it never said this before ). So I contacted NCC BUSINESS SERVICES onXX/XX/XXXX to see the status of the account. I spoke with a representative by the name of XXXX and asked him if this was open and if they were still collecting on it and he said "" yes ''. I explained to him what was mentioned above and he then informed me he would submit for a "" debt reduction '' and he would call back once he spoke with management on an answer. I asked why he would be able to submit for a "" debt reduction '' now when all these years I was told they did n't do settlements/reduce balances and that I needed to just make payments towards the balance. He told me because "" I did n't qualify ''. So I then asked how NCC BUSINESS SERVICES would know if I qualified or not because nobody every asked me any questions regarding my circumstance to determine if I did or did n't qualify? He said because we were n't on unemployment, on SSI, disability etc. Which is actually inaccurate because for XXXX XXXX ( my ex who was also on the lease with me ) was unemployed during a portion of the time we lived in this apartment. However, I was still employed while all this took place and even asked ( during a previous call ) to do a single party settlement to remove my name only and pursue XXXX for the remainder and was denied this workout option as well. XXXX quickly changed topics and asked if he can get the debt reduction approved if I was prepared to pay the payment all at once. I said I was, but still wanted to know why now all of a sudden this was a possibility when it had n't been for the past 4+ years.

First, we applied in XXXX with a valid hardship. We submitted all documentation to verify all non-borrower contributors. However, Wells Fargo only utilized one income ( the borrowers ). When questioned, Wells initially said they DID utilize all non-borrower contributors ( which would have been 3 additional incomes, PLUS the borrowers income ). When pressed for documentation, they then said they did not use all the non-borrower contributions because they believed the borrower did not live in the household. He did live in the household. They never asked for any documentation NOR did they state that was the reason for denial until the following year. 

The second time we tried for loan modification in XXXX, we were denied for almost everything due to a chapter XXXX bankruptcy we had to file to save our home. We were approved for a short sale. We appealed this, because we received a promotion at work with higher pay AND because the bankruptcy was dismissed. In their calculations, they also used two different incomes. I asked why, and they did not respond. They stated we did not make enough money to support a repayment plan. I asked the NPR calculation used and which income they used. They did not respond. They denied our appeal and said we would need to resubmit an entire loan modification packet to be reviewed without the bankruptcy. 

Right after the denial of the appeal, they set a foreclosure sale date. 

We asked for a short sale approval since we were previously approved for one, they said no. 

I am reapplying for loan modification but each time I submit a piece of verification paperwork they ask for more things. This means they are going to keep denying it until they take my home.

I noticed my student loan monthly payment went up to {$200.00} when Nelnet emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX. Also I made 3 payments in XX/XX/XXXX to make my account current. I called Nelnet 2 days later on XX/XX/XXXX twice to find the reason why my monthly payment increased. I don't remember the first reps name, but she told me the reason why my payments went up, is because I'm on the graduated payment plan and I've already made 24 monthly payments. That is a blatant lie, since my loan transferred to Nelnet in XX/XX/XXXX and I paid {$190.00} that month, which was my monthly payment I had at XXXX XXXX before Nelnet took my loan over. Nelnet in a letter I received said it would be ok to pay that same amount for first month and then I would have to pick a payment plan. I picked the graduated plan and for the first 24 months I would pay {$160.00}. So, I called back after doing some research to find out how many payments I made. I actually only made 16 payments up til that point, so I should technically have 8 more months, now 7, to go before my payments go up. I called Nelnet back the same day and spoke to XXXX ; I explained the reason for my call and what the first rep said. After a couple minutes of XXXX reviewing my account, she said the reason my payment increased, was because interest had recalculated when I get off the auto debit program, which makes no sense either and I even stated that on the phone before the call ended. That answer isn't legit either. I was on the auto pay at the end of XX/XX/XXXX for a couple months and when I got off of the auto pay program my payments never went up, because of the interest recalculating. So, at that point I emailed Nelnet to see If I could get a correct answer, since obviously the reps that are working at Nelnet have no idea what they are doing and talking about. Nelnet emailed me back a few days later and said in the email to call them. I called Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX and the rep said that when my loan came over Nelnet ; Nelnet didn't have the right terms for the payments, so when Nelnet found out, the terms were corrected. I a lot of things are wrong with this : First off, the first 2 of the reps lied, which I'm pretty sure is a violation of the FDCPA. Second it shouldn't have taken 3 calls to get the correct answer. Third I shouldn't have to bite the bullet per se, because Nelnet couldn't do their job before they took complete ownership of my student loan in the first place. Lastly a flag should have been seen by Nelnets system between the {$190.00} payment and the {$160.00} payment. So, I applied for an income driven payment plan.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",OH,43202,,Consent provided,Web,2019-11-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3432130

314584,2020-01-13,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,I started calling to PNC Bank to obtain my pay off amount in XX/XX/XXXX9. My  payments were submitted by XXXX XXXX accelerated program and were always submitted on time. They deducted from my bank account every two weeks a set and consistently throughout the year Occasionally there would be an extra amount in which XXXX XXXX would submit to PNC as a principal payment and noted as such on the manual check and mailed to pnc for posting. PNC applied most payments correctly but I did find a few that were not applied correctly and interest deducted from those payments. I started my inquiry when I requested my payoff amount. I never received monthly ststements from PNC to show payment activity. When I looked over my history in XX/XX/XXXX I noticed some payments were not applied correctly. I called and requested PNC to review my loan starting from inception date in XX/XX/XXXX. PNC acknowledged error and corrected two of the payments in which this lowered my payoff amount. I called back to pnc to let them know there was still two payments to be corrected. I wanted tbe correct payoff amount before paying off my auto. PNC NEVER CALLED BACK. I was always the initiator for the status of inquiry. This started in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX still reviewing case open. In XX/XX/XXXX i called again to convey my frustration. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX there was a decision and they would not consider XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to be posted correctly and recalculate interest as they were too old. But they did reapply another XX/XX/XXXX principal only payment. This was clearly their error and did not post payments correctly therefore I overpaid on my loan. I did payoff loan in november so i did not accrue further daily interest. This loan was paid off approximately one year early with never a late payment. I just want to pay the correct payoff amount with the correct interest applied. If they do this to other people and their defense is that it is up to the consumer to track their payments but they do not hold themselves responsible as to have quality employees to apply payments correctly. They add re making money off this process. My final complaint was if they can not calculate back to those two payments then figure a fair amount that would be refunded to me. They closed complaint and stated they could not help me. This took 4 months to let me know they could not do anything about it. Then their employee that was working on my file lied about calling me back and stating phone number was not good or could not leave voicemail.

I met the workers in the late morning and let them in the home. Several days later, I contacted the contractor to arrange payment and was told that they were finishing up the work at that very moment. I told them that was impossible because my job only supposed to take one afternoon. I was told that additional work beyond what I had requested was performed. I told them that no additional work was requested or approved. I was told that the company owner would contact me to discuss. In spite of calling him several times and leaving messages, to date, I have never heard directly from him. Eventually, I received a bill for approximately {$2500.00} more than the job should've cost based on information gathered from other contractors. Upon reviewing the documents included in the bill, I discovered that the contractor claimed to have performed much more work than they were hired to do. They justified all of this extra work by presenting work orders signed by my tenant. I asked my tenant about this and he said that the contractor told him that I had requested this work and that it was ok for him to sign for me. Of course, this was not true. In fact, I never signed anything related to this job whatsoever. The contractor 's documents even attempt to assert that the job was related to an insurance claim with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have never insured this property with XXXX XXXX and the original job I requested was in no way related to any insurance claim. I sent a check to the contractor in the amount that his competitors indicated they would've charged. The contractor refused to accept my check as payment and eventually turned me over to collections. Upon hearing from the collection agency, I referred them to my attorney and have heard nothing more from them. In XX/XX/2015 this collection showed up on my credit report. I contacted Equifax and disputed it. I provided all of the various documentation clearly showing the signature of my tenant on the work orders. I explained the entire situation and that obviously, my tenants are never authorized to obligate me to pay for work performed by contractors.

I have been financing a 2016 KIA Soul through Kia Finance for 1 year now. I have made every single payment on time and have had no problems, until I tried shipping my vehicle overseas due to a military XXXX. I started this process with Kia Finance three weeks ago and it is still not solved. First off, my wife called the service desk number XXXX over 3 weeks ago. She asked about the process on how to ship a vehicle overseas and the response was that a "" Vehicle Transport Request Form '' was needed and that we should receive it in the mail between XXXX five business days. XXXX five business days go by and we received nothing, to this day we still have not received this from Kia Finance. After five business days, I call XXXX, a different customer support number. This customer support number "" apologizes for the inconvenience '' and lets me know that the form is available online for me to print out ... We fill out the form immediately and fax it to XXXX with all of the extra required forms. I call the customer support phone number XXXX the next day and they say "" unfortunately, they still have not received the documents, it can anywhere from XXXX five business days to receive the paperwork. '' I have never heard of a fax taking five business days to be received. I let 72 business hours go by and call back customer support and I get more or less the same answer "" unfortunately, they still have not received the documents, it can anywhere from XXXX five business days to receive the paperwork and I can try faxing it to a different number '' ( I do not remember the second fax number by it was confirmed multiple times by customer service that it was also a correct fax number. At this point it is getting closer and closer to my military move and I literally call customer service every day and get no help at all. All customer service has to say is that "" unfortunately, they have not received the documents and there is nothing they can do. '' Furiously, I ask for supervisors and managers, still calling every day. Some supervisors said that another office does this entire process and there are "" no phones '' in their building and no way to contact them. Another supervisor said he would email them and "" should get a response within 72 hours. '' 72 hours go by ... no response. At this point I am less than a week away from moving and need to make something happen, so I refinance. I am now going to have to pay over {$800.00} in finance charges that I would n't have had to pay with Kia Finance, but it would all be worth it, because XXXX was able to give me a letter authorizing me to ship my vehicle overseas ( I got the loan approval and the letter of approval in less than 15 minutes on the phone with a XXXX employee ), even before they receive the title from Kia. I priority shipped the check on a Friday and figured I would be able to ship my vehicle overseas on Monday no problem. Well, I was wrong again. Since my registration stated that Kia Finance had my title, the shipping company needed something from Kia Finance stating that my loan was either paid in full or a letter authorizing me to ship the vehicle overseas. Obviously, I get back on the phone with customer support and ask to have either or. No help once again. "" Nothing in our system shows that you sent a check or your account is paid in full. '' Jokes on you this time Kia, I have a tracking number from USPS that shows that it has been delivered. Arguing all day long that they have my money and all I need from them is nothing more than a piece of paper, a supervisor in the morning tells me that as soon the check is received they will process it and email it to me and fax it to the shipping company ( at this point they have not yet picked up the package at their",,HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA,FL,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2017-02-07,Closed,Yes,Yes,2329686

I made several transactions with one user there, each one was for a value of {$500.00} USD, each one i loaded into my "" safe '' in my account at reloadit.com. The rules say i could load up to XXXX $ per day and $ 10k per account. After a couple weeks Reloadit locked my accounts with a total of {$3000.00} in them. I called and opened a case, and provided the documentation they asked for right away. 
I can write an entire complaint based on the incredibly atrocious customer service. There were lies, rudeness, deliberate disconnections ( hang-ups ), and smug behavior as they enjoyed hearing me getting angry and helpless. One supervisor even laughed at me when i asked for his employee number so i could make note of this and report it ( XXXX, employee # XXXX ) I wo n't go into the detail of the XXXX phones calls i made getting jerked around, and hours i spent on hold just to be asked a few questions to be put on hold again to be transferred to someone else ( cycle repeats ). 
They ignored the fact that i provided the correct documentation and asked for the store receipts of the purchases which they knew i could not produce because i told them i obtained these codes via XXXX. I do have documentation showing that i obtained these codes through the service at XXXX. i submitted screen shots of all the invoices/receipts from the transactions. They have ignored this evidence and then last i called they told me i have 2 hours to submit the receipts from the store or my case will be closed forever without possibility to reopen it again.. Now they WILL NOT EVEN LET ME SPEAK TO THAT DEPARTMENT. I ca n't speak to anyone who has the pwower to unlock my account and each person i speak to that would be able to transfer me has explicit instructions to not allow me to speak to them. 
I fell like i have been robbed and violated. I am not out of {$3000.00} and feel completely helpless. I would like to take full action against this company and i know there are others like me who this is happening to. The reason i knew to file this complaint is because i shared my story on the forum at XXXX and have learned that his has happened to many others. Blackhawk Network must be stopped and prosecuted for robbing the consumers. 
On a final note, my girlfriend has an account with {$1000.00} in it and every time she tries to withdraw the money she gets an error, this has been happening for several days and it 's beginning to appear as though her money is being robbed as well.",,Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc.,IL,607XX,,Consent provided,Web,2015-04-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1305102

Well that could not be more false. The additional and hidden fees at Scottrade are enormous and Scottrade does charge more than {$7.00} per trade. 

What is most worrisome is that Scottrade could not explain each one of these fees for me and instead repeatedly asked me to call the national center for advice. The national center could not answer them either, only stated that they would get back to me within a week.

XX/XX/XXXX we approached our mortgage lender Bank of America ( BOA ). We wanted to refinance our home that we have lived in since XX/XX/XXXX. At the time we approached BOA we were not in foreclose, we were current on all of our loan payments and we were not in distress. BOA turned us down for a conventional refinanced mortgage loan but offered us what they explained was a NEW program for customers that were current with their mortgage but wanted to reduce their payments. We were excited about the new program unknowing that it would hurt our credit and put our home into a foreclosure situation. Our loan officer said we were accepted into the program and our payments were being reduced approximately {$540.00} per month. We were told to make this payment for three months and the new loan would be in place after that. We asked our loan officer if the mortgage came back unacceptable could we refuse it, pay back the difference and keep the original mortgage. Our loan officer reinsured us that we could do this without penalty or credit damage. After three months past, we contacted BOA ; Our loan officer informed us that it was taking longer than expected but to keep paying the monthly mortgage at the reduced rate. 
After the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th months BOA keep giving us the same story, it was taking longer than expected, it 's not you ( the homeowner ) but the bank that is having issues with the paperwork, BOA instructed us to keep paying our scheduled reduced mortgage and the contract will come soon. It was on the Ninth month that the new mortgage plan finally came. The new mortgage plan was a disaster and we went from a 23 year mortgage to a 40 year mortgage with a balloon payment at the end. 
For obvious reasons we refused this new mortgage plan and continued with the existing mortgage. We never signed or entered into any new agreements that BOA or XXXX provide. No acceptance to their terms or conditions was accepted. It was only after refusing the new mortgage that BOA destroyed our credit and sold off our mortgage to XXXX. Once XXXX took over the loan it went downhill from there. XXXX would not discuss any terms or help us with the issues that BOA left us in. We paid large fees to XXXX that they forced us to pay to keep our home out of foreclose. All during the time while this was happening I still made my monthly payments on time, and every month with documentation of every payment. XXXX is a debt collecting company and they also duplicated bad credit reporting from BOA. 
I 'm attaching a letter from Ice Legal to BOA as evidence of my complaint ; I 'm also attaching a letter from BOA saying that they would partially correct our credit report and that it was done in error. Also I have requested a payment history on all payments made to BOA and XXXX. To this day I have not received any payment records nor have they corrected the errors on the XXXX credit reporting bureaus I 'm requesting that BOA and XXXX correct and remove all of the damaging information that 's on all three credit reporting bureaus. The dates and information that they are reporting are wrong and should not be there in the first place. BOA and XXXX knowingly and willingly took advantage of us and should have never offered us a loan that would cause us harm to our credit and possible foreclose to our home. I believe what BOA did was illegal and misleading, and there actions should be investigated. How many other hard working customers have they purposely for sole purpose only destroyed their credit and tried to take their home? I have personal bank records that show the history that I have made every loan payment including the trial payments on time from the beginning of the loan XX/XX/XXXX.

232507,2019-12-10,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I would like to report PHEAAs unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices that left me damaged financially. I am seeking to be made whole. I, along with my debt advocate XXXX, called PHEAA on XX/XX/XXXX regarding my defaulted loan balance. The customer rep was XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX proceeded to explain PHEAAs rehabilitation program and asked me a series of questions to determine the amount I would have to pay monthly. One of the  questions XXXX ( my debt advocate ) asked XXXX was whether my Federal Income Tax refund check which had been previously intercepted by the Fiscal Service of the Treasury Dept. would be intercepted upon establishing the payment program. XXXX  response was that as soon as I enrolled in the rehab program, my tax refund check would no longer be intercepted and reiterated that I needed to complete my enrollment in the program while she had us on the phone. She then said I needed to sign some documents right away to start the process. She proceeded to send me documents via email that needed to be signed using XXXX. XXXX also processed an initial payment to verify my payment bank account. 

While on the phone, XXXX repeatedly asked XXXX to explain the terms ( fine print ) contained in the 10-payment agreement document that I was asked to sign while on the phone. XXXX mentioned multiple times that since there wasnt enough time for her to independently review the document, her presence on the phone call was to ensure that none of the terms would harm me or the debt management process I had embarked on. XXXX then said that she too was wary of my having my debt advocate on the call since she was also acting in my best interest and would explain everything on the document I was asked to sign. XXXX went on to explain the terms of the payment agreement and confirm yet again that my tax refund check would not be intercepted once I enrolled in the program that day. I signed the documents as soon as I received the email with XXXX on the line, with XXXX then verifying that I signed it correctly. 

I later filed my tax returns with my tax accountant in XXXX and to my shock, on XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a letter from the Treasury Dept. saying my refund check had been intercepted and sent to PHEAA. I emailed XXXX immediately to find out why this was the case because she had confirmed it would not happen. She did not respond until I called PHEAA after a week on XX/XX/XXXX and surprisingly got XXXX as my PHEAA for the second time. 

On the call on XX/XX/XXXX, I reminded XXXX of our call with my debt advocate ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and asked why my check was intercepted and she said she had given me the wrong information that the rules were changed in XX/XX/XXXX that 5 successful draft payments were required to be made before interceptions could be removed from the rehab program account. I complained that she never gave me that information and I reminded her that my debt advocate ( XXXX ) specifically asked her more than once of PHEAAs rules on interception of refund checks. I made it clear that she misinformed me and that as a result of this misinformation, my refund got intercepted. I immediately requested that PHEAA release the check back to me to rectify this error and she said she had to speak to her supervisor and I was put on hold for several minutes. She came back and said the call transcript from XX/XX/XXXX was pulled and reviewed and it was confirmed she indeed gave me wrong information, but that her supervisor said the check would not be released. XXXX apologized for the wrong information and let me know it was now out of her hands. XXXX appeared to be aware of PHEAAs unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to complain again and see if I could get remedy for the damages I sustained based on PHEAAs misrepresentation to me. I got rep. XXXX XXXX. I detailed my call on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and she looked at the notes on my account and said she could not do anything. I ask to speak with a supervisor. XXXX then put me on hold and came back and said the supervisor said the check will not be released. I was not allowed to speak with a supervisor. I ask to speak with the supervisor 's higher up and she put me on hold again and then came back and said that she was sorry that XXXX gave me the wrong info. The supervisors she spoke with were XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. From the way XXXX ( on the second conversation ) and XXXX spoke to me, it appeared that these representatives are aware of predatory practices by PHEAA. At no pint was I allowed to speak with a supervisor despite my repeated attempts to speak with one. Each time the representatives went back and forth to speak with the supervisor and always ended up saying they did not have the power to do anything yet was never allowed to speak with the person that did. They acted scared and aware of unethical practices enforced by supervisors at PHEAA. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the CFPB ( XXXX ) and PHEAA documented that a representative reached out to me on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the requirement to have the offset cease. However, PHEAAs representation to CFPB was deceptive and in no way provided any resolution. In fact, they mentioned reviewing my tax returns which does not address their deceptive misrepresentation and the need to remedy the financial damages I sustained by their actions. 

An acceptable resolution is for PHEAA to return the check due to me that was wrongly intercepted. I was hurried asked to sign documents over the phone and despite repeatedly asking XXXX about the details of the program she was offering, she misinformed me about the details of the program. I did exactly as she instructed me to and as a result, my refund check was intercepted. During my call on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX admitted to have given me the wrong information and spoke with her supervisor. She confirmed the call on XX/XX/XXXX was reviewed with the supervisor and confirmed she gave me the wrong information while urging me to sign the payment agreement documents over the phone. 

I would like this matter escalated because PHEAA has proven to be unethical, deceptive, and abusive in their dealings with me. The only acceptable remediation is for PHEAA to return the tax refund check in the full amount back to me.",,AES/PHEAA,TX,760XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3463938

I have an Auto loan with PNC Bank and per our "" Direct Installment Loan Disclosure and Note Agreement '' here are the following terms .... 

XXXX Number of Payments : 36 XXXX Amount of Payments : {$370.00} XXXX When Payments Are Due : Monthly, beginning XX/XX/2016 I have found out that all three credit reporting agencies XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, are reporting that my repayments terms are for 38 months instead of 36. Thiscalculation worksout to bea differentsof {$750.00} more when you use that number. 

When PNC Bank contacted me by mailoffering to refinance my auto, one of the main selling points was that they allow you to chose from 30 to 90 days before your first payment isdue, I choose the 90 days. 

I signed the Agreement in the XXXX Virginia location on XX/XX/2016 and thefirst payment isdue on XX/XX/2016, around 90 days. 

They are telling me since the funds where available onthe date I signed, they have a right to report38 months instead of 36. 

I was in the process of doing aDebt consolidation loan, when this was brought to my attention. They are saying that they will have to add the $ XXXXdifferents of 2 monthsin order to do a pay off for my auto since PNC Bank is reporting 38 months as the terms of repayment. 

On XX/XX/2016 I called PNC Bank, the person I spoke with concerning this matter is Name XXXX XXXX in the Escalation Department of PNC Bank XXXX. He acknowledge that the contract I signed was for a repayment term of 36 months, but that they have a right to report 38 months instead of 36 months. He refused to transfer me to his supervisor or anyone in the so called "" Back Office People Dept '' and that he was the manager and there was no one else I could speak to concerning this matter. 

I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read and review this compliant.

1167990,2017-02-04,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Making/receiving payments, sending money",,"I have maintained my checking account with Chase Bank ( formerly Bank One ) in good standing since XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited a check in the amount of {$1800.00} to my checking account at the local Chase Bank branch located on XXXX in XXXX, WI. The check came from someone I had sold an item to over XXXX. It was over the amount of the item sold by {$1600.00}, the buyer was moving to where I live, and I was asked by the buyer to send the remaining amount back to the buyer 's moving company. The buyer repeatedly asked me if she could trust me with the extra money, and I told her that she could trust me as long as her check cleared. 

Since I did not know the buyer, I wanted to be certain that the funds were in my account before I sent any money. I visited my local branch on XX/XX/XXXX and explained the situation to the Bank Manager, XXXX, and asked for his advice on when it would be safe for me to send the money. His advice was to not send any money until Chase Bank had collected the funds, and funds had been deposited to my account. He told me to check back later in the day or the next day. I called the Chase Bank toll free number the next morning and was told that funds had been collected and deposited into my account, and it was safe for me to send the money. I then visited my local branch where a teller ( XXXX ) confirmed this information. She explained that she could now verify that funds had been physically collected from the issuing bank and been deposited into my account. She assured me that it was now safe for me to send the money. Upon getting this confirmation in person, I withdrew {$1600.00} from my checking account and sent it to the moving company via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX 

The next morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that Chase had withdrawn the money from my account as the check had bounced. I immediately visited the Bank Manager to inquire about what had happened. After looking into it he informed me that the check was indeed fraudulent and had bounced. He said that even though they had confirmed that money had been collected and deposited into my account, the bank had a right to withdraw funds from my account. He told me that the bank bears no responsibility for bounced checks, and that there was nothing further they could do to assist me. I asked him why I was not provided this information earlier when I had repeatedly asked for it. He had no answer for me, and instead scrambled to look for bank policies. After discussing with other managers, he provided me with highlighted bank policy, which he said was given to me when I opened the account, which was almost 30 years ago. I later filed a complaint with Chase Corporate office, and after a few days I was informed that everything was handled appropriately, that bank policies are listed in the deposit agreement, and that bank officials were not obligated to provide me with the information I had repeatedly requested. 

I believe I did the due diligence on my part to protect myself from this fraudulent transaction. I trusted my bank to protect my interests, but even after my repeated inquiries, the Bank Manager and rest of bank staff failed to inform me of applicable bank policies. They only looked for bank policies after funds had already been sent and the check had bounced, and informed me that it was my responsibility to be aware of the policies. I believe that it was bank staff 's responsibility to provide me this information, especially after I had repeatedly asked them for bank policies on when it would be safe for me to send the money. I believe the reason I was not provided this information is because the Bank Manager and rest of the bank staff were either not aware of these policies themselves due to inadequate training on bank policies regarding fraudulent transactions, or they dealt with me with negligence.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,WI,537XX,,Consent provided,Web,2017-02-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2328186
1528553,2018-11-13,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I have been a loyal Suntrust Bank account holder for years. On XX/XX/XXXX I was checking my online account and noticed a XXXX over the counter withdrawal that was made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was in disbelief and very shocked. First of all, I had not been notified to even confirm that I had withdrawn this very large amount which is out of my normal transactions. Second of all I was out of state visiting a family member when the withdrawal took place and I was using my debit card.. So how could I be in 2 different places at once making different transactions. I clicked on it and it brought up the withdrawal slip and the first thing I noticed was my signature on it 2 times. On the first signature the last part of my name was crossed out with an X and my name resigned the "" correct '' way with the loop on the R of my last name XXXX. 
I immediately called the main branch on XXXX XXXX because this is where most of my transactions take place. No answer and I was sent to the branch managers voicemail. I left a message about the money that had been withdrawn by someone else other than me out of my checking account. I never even heard back from him until 2 weeks later and it wasn't even him it was another bank employee stating that his manager asked him to return my phone call. Moving forward.. After calling the XXXX XXXX I called the XXXX Suntrust number. I talked to someone in the fraud department and told them what happened and the first thing she said was that I made the withdrawal. I said no, someone else did. She would not give me any information pertaining to where this happened or who did it other than to say it would be turned over to an investigator from Suntrust and that I would be contacted within 15 business days by an investigator. 
I talked to another Suntrust location to try and find out where this withdrawal had taken place and he said Florida. I then called my local police to report this theft and had a police report filed. It was turned over to an investigator. The same day, I went to a local branch and opened a new account to transfer the bulk of my money to but couldn't close out the compromised account because items were still pending. The employee that helped me was very nice but when I told her my story and my concern with the way the transaction was handled ( meaning the double signature and that the signature was verified ) she said that procedures were followed. I did not know the full story at that time though because procedures were most certainly not followed. 
Meanwhile I played the waiting game. On XX/XX/XXXX business days later, I called Suntrust again because no one had attempted to contact me. I was told that my request would have a rush put on it and someone would contact me within 24-48 hrs. On XX/XX/XXXX, the 15th business day, an investigator finally contacted me from Suntrust and asked me questions and I told her my concerns with how the withdrawal had taken place. She said that she would turn in all the paperwork to begin the process of getting my money back and that I would need to have a paper signed in front of a notary stating that I had no involvement with this withdrawal. 
I talked to the police investigator several times through emails and phone calls and on one of those times, XX/XX/XXXX, he sent the address where someone had went inside a Suntrust Bank and withdrawn money from my account. It was address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TN XXXX I live in Georgia and have never lived in Tennessee. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the police investigator emailed me details of who walked in to a Suntrust Bank and stole money out of my account. To my knowledge Suntrust has a picture of me or my license with my picture on it to verify I am who I say I am. Not to mention countless photos over the years of me coming inside the branches or doing business at the outside of the bank through the drive-through. I am a XXXX  female who has lived in Georgia only and banked with Suntrust for numerous years. The person who stole my money is a XXXX female who used a Tennessee drivers license with my information on it. A TN drivers license!!, How she was able to do this is absurd and should have never been allowed to happen! I say allow because after everything I have seen and heard about how this took place there were absolutely no procedures in place to prevent it. 
The police investigator asked if I had received my money. I said not yet because the Suntrust investigator said that I had to wait until the police could get to the video of the transaction to make sure everything was how I described and also waiting on my signed document stating no involvement. The investigator said that Suntrust already has all this information that theyre the ones that gave it to him. Well I was shocked again because not only does Suntrust have evidence that I didn't do it, that clearly this is a case of identity theft, to top it off Suntrust again had not contacted me about any of this! This is my money!! That I chose to put into a Suntrust Bank. That I kept in all of these years and have had numerous accounts in and fees taken out, and a mortgage with, and a line of credit! 
I gave Suntrust time ( 1 business week ) and thought surely someone from Suntrust would contact me, their "" valued '' client. I was mistaken. Once again I had to be the one to contact them. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed the investigator and told her that the police investigator had already informed me of certain information that proves I am the victim of identity fraud and I did not withdraw money from my account and asked why I was not notified. I also asked that the money be returned to my account without having to sign a paper stating no involvement. She responded the same day by not answering my question as to why I haven't been contacted and apologized that I was not comfortable with the process. She said that the paper is needed to be able to be used in court as evidence against the fraudster and that as soon as I turn in the paper they will credit my account. I can not fathom that a bank would in essence aid criminals and treat their long term clients or any client as the criminal instead. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received my money back that was stolen from my account, through a teller, by a person that walked into an out of state bank XXXX per my address on file ) used an out of state license and double signed my signature and was not asked to provide a social security number. phone number or even a previous address for proof of verification. I was asked all of that when I went into a Suntrust branch to withdraw a huge, whopping XXXX bucks. Much less XXXX Although it was on the same day I reported the incidence to Suntrust and I was in there having to open up a new account and scrambling to make sure everything was done properly to ensure some safety measures. Which by the way were already in place due to an incidence of someone stealing, not my debit card, but just the numbers from my debit card twice before. That was handled pretty quickly and the money put back in my account. 
The many, many errors of Suntrust and their employee, led to my money being stolen from my account. This should never have happened. I hear it happens multiple times, every day. Not to me it doesn't. If it does why are there not better procedures in place to prevent it? Better training. Alerts, etc. Again though.. this was allowed to happen in my opinion. And to add insult to injury Im the one that has to prove Im not the criminal. Im the one that has to be worried that this person is going to do this again to me and next time all of my money will be gone and no way to live. You have all the evidence you need to know Im not the one that withdrew the money yet Im still waiting on it to be put back into my account. On top of all of that, to not even have the courtesy to call me back or to keep me informed throughout this whole process, all of it has been unacceptable.

In XXXX, I made a XXXX year contract for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Between XXXX and XXXX my husband XXXX XXXX took the car to do the service to the car in the same XXXX XXXX. Days later my husband realizes that they changed the carpet of the driver because he took it out to clean it and to our surprise they were broken. My husband went to the XXXX to claim, and they changed it but the car also felt with a small fault and in the XXXX they said that it was the cold weather that put the cars like that. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my husband I opened the hood of the car, and we realized that the battery had been changed by a used but with much use that was seen even with the eyes closed that was in very bad condition. My husband XXXX XXXX and I went to the XXXX XXXX, and we talked to XXXX of the owners of the franchise and authorized him to change it. We spoke with XXXX of the owners so that he himself knew what was happening. 

The XXXX of the car dealers named XXXX XXXX when we were no longer my husband and I called and offered to change the car to a XXXX XXXX XXXX with a new contract of XXXX years. We asked him that it was still almost a year before he finished the contract that it was like that. The XXXX XXXX XXXX offered us that the XXXX was going to pay the rest of the contract but we did not accept the anger we had for everything they had done. 

In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I had to take the service to the car and a salesman who realized the problem we had had returned to offer to change the car and I decided with my husband to listen to the offer. The seller with the name XXXX made us the same offer that the XXXX XXXX would pay the remaining payments. I asked him what else had to be paid and the seller 's response was that the financier did not let anyone know. 

When the XXXX XXXX financier called us to finish the contract, he explained everything to me and my husband XXXX XXXX. My husband asked for the excess miles and the financier said there was no problem because the XXXX XXXX would pay for everything and also offered us for {$50.00} plus every month an insurance that covered what was not covered by the XXXX XXXX or the XXXX guarantees everything except wear as tires, battery, lights and extra miles as that insurance covered top that. Several times we asked him if he covered the odd ones, and he said yes. I agree to change the car to a XXXX XXXX XXXX under the condition of paying {$50.00} plus all months other than the {$270.00} contract payment. 





I signed several documents but the financier gave me XXXX copies and the other information he gave me in a XXXX XXXX with the name of XXXX. After XXXX days I checked the XXXX XXXX and it was empty and I immediately went to the XXXX XXXX   with my husband XXXX XXXX, and they told us that the financier XXXX XXXX had voted him a fraudster and that he would call me another financier in the next few days. 


I spend almost a month without anyone calling and I went to XXXX XXXX, and they told me to talk to another financier named XXXX XXXX and explained that the financier XXXX XXXX had fooled me that the extra {$50.00} insurance does not cover extra miles. I told the financier to cancel the contract and give me my XXXX XXXX car of XXXX and I returned the one that took the year XXXX. The financier told me that it could not because the car had already taken it to the auction that only What I could do was eliminate the extra {$50.00} insurance. I had to take it because I did not have another option, they put me between my back and the wall. 

After XXXX months it was that I received from the XXXX XXXX XXXX a statement that I have to pay {$3500.00} for excess miles. I called them on the phone and told them I did not agree with what they had scammed me. 

In conclusion in XX/XX/XXXX I made a contract for a XXXX XXXX car from XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX years later with lies offer me to pay the missing months and the extra mile payment to change the car for a XXXX XXXX. It turns out that the financier votes him for the fraudster and now I have to pay {$3500.00} for an extra mile. I asked that the car be returned to me in XXXX and cancel the contract and in XX/XX/XXXX I had XXXX options. The first I could pay the difference of the debt of the car and stay with it. The second fund the remaining debt and stay with the car paying every month a paid at the end of the car is mine. The last and the worst for me but for them the best to deliver the car and I pay {$3500.00} of extra miles under a fraud they did to me. 

Now I pay $ 270 monthly for the car in XXXX and the financier wants me to pay the {$3500.00}. I want my XXXX XXXX XXXX car back or that XXXX be responsible for the payment of {$3500.00}. 

In the last document dated XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Department has not yet registered the car as delivered.

I was advised by "" XXXX '' that i should have maintained a monthly minimum charged balance, paying monthly on these XXXX revolving accounts, I questioned again an additional open XXXX retail charges, and was assured it would have protected my scoring, but since they have been reported in this manner they will remain for an additional ten year period, though "" closed '' paid as agreed, no activity dormant accounts.

On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I received an email from NetCredit stating I owed {$200.00} ( {$100.00} for XXXX XXXX and {$100.00} for XXXX XXXX ). 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I called NetCredit to make my XXXX XXXX payment. I was transferred to the Collections Department and informed the representative that I wanted to pay what was owed for that XXXX XXXX payment. I was told I owed {$100.00} and I approved the payment. This was on day XXXX, not XXXX. I paid exactly what I was told I owed. Had I been told I owed {$150.00}, I would have paid {$150.00}. 
At the end of the call, the representative stated my account was now current and my next payment was due on XX/XX/2019. I made that payment on XX/XX/2019. 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I received an alert that there was a change to my credit report. It read NC FINANCIAL has flagged your account as 30 days past due. I was baffled. I assert that this is fully due to an error on the part of NetCredit and am formally requesting an adjustment. I will also submit this request via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, Sr. Compliance Associate, via telephone and was connected to her voicemail. I left a rather frantic message. I then followed up with an email. 
I logged onto my NetCredit account and there was now a message which read Your payment due on Wednesday, XX/XX/2019 is now overdue. Please make a payment as soon as possible. Again, I called in and made my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid what I was told I owed by the NetCredit Collections Department representative. 
I followed up with another email to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. At this time, my NetCredit online account showed I only owed {$100.00} for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I logged on and paid that on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I again followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I finally received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated I actually owed {$110.00} on XX/XX/2019. She stated that since I did not pay that full amount, my account was reported as 30 days late for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. If I owed that amount, why did the Collections Department representative tell me I only owed {$100.00}? Why after I paid that {$100.00} did the Collections Department representative tell me my account was paid until the next due date of XX/XX/XXXX? Why was I never told I owed {$110.00}? 
Of course I would have paid the {$110.00} if the representative had told me that was what I owed! Why would I have allowed my account to go 30 days late over {$6.00}? That is absurd! Of course I would have paid what I was told I owed when I called in on XX/XX/XXXX! I DID pay what I was told I owed! 
To show that, I immediately made a payment of {$10.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I would have paid that amount on XX/XX/XXXX, but was not told I needed to. 
At the start of the telephone call on XX/XX/2019, I was informed the call would be recorded. Locate that recording and you will hear exactly what the collections representative told me. 
I am being severely penalized over less than {$10.00}. Please remove the late report as it was due to a miscommunication in what was owed by NetCredit to me.",,"ENOVA INTERNATIONAL, INC.",SC,,,Consent provided,Web,2020-01-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3489352

And after having the card for about ten months, I went to the branch and asked whether it was possible for me to be given a regular credit card. The banker helped me to apply for the regular card, and promised to call me with any updates, which she never did. The application was rejected due to the reason that I am not a permanent resident. Even though I could understand the reasoning, and can accept this decision, Commerce Bank and their local employees did not at any point during this process informed me that the bank does not approve regular credit cards to non-resident, while knowing for a fact that I am not a XXXX citizen or a permanent resident. To be more specific, at the time of opening of the secured card, I asked them about the possibility for getting a regular credit card after opening the secured one for about a year, and the banker told me that it was possible, and when I went to the branch to apply for the regular card, the banker XXXX same one ) did not mention the fact that the regular card is not available for non-residents. I am not sure that if it is an actual break of law or any regulation, but I was under the wrong impression that getting a regular card was a possibility. I am not satisfied with the fact that Commerce Bank did not point out this rule, and this information is nowhere to be found on their website or the materials sent to me. 

The second part of the complaint is that after I learned that I was rejected the regular card, I asked the local branch to close my secure account, as there is no point to keep this useless card while paying for the {$49.00} annual fee. At first, I called the customer service, and the representative told me that I needed to go to the local branch to close the account, and that I might still be charged for the annual fee, because they would need 30 days to process this request ( I decided to close the account on XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). I just could not understand how is this even possible ( being charged for the annual fee even though I decided to close the account, and the fact that it takes 30 days to close the account ), but I followed their demand and went to the local branch to close the account. The banker submitted my request and told me that it usually takes less than 30 days for the process to be finished, and I should get my money back in about three weeks ( I have the recording of our conversation as I could not trust their words anymore ). 

I put in my request on XXXX/XXXX/2015, and the card, later I found out, was closed on XXXX/XXXX/2015. However, after waiting for over 30 days for my money to be put into my checking account with them, I still have not received it as of today XXXX/XXXX/2015. I tried to call them last week asking about this issue, and they promised to call me back, but they never did.

I was approved for a FHA loan with an adjustable rate mortgage. I used an attorney provided by XXXX XXXX, Guaranteed Rate or MERS, it was very unclear to me. The loan was originated under XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX in order for the investors or holders of the loan to avoid tax liability in the event they had to foreclose on the property. Additionally, I believe they are defrauding the US government by double dipping with loan write offs post foreclosure. In my case that sum was greater than 80K USD. Additionally, I was informed the loan was not tied to my SSN which is why I am still liable for the tax liens. If you read the XXXX XXXX XXXX agreement it seems very clear to me as a consumer they were responsible for the taxes. Please review all of the attached documents. I also submitted my complaint to the FBI, and have started to send the information out to private attorneys. I would think a FHA loan would have been tied to my SSN as the loan appeared on my credit report. I also notified XXXX XXXX who I had been making payments to that I needed help. I applied for a loan modification and was denied under the basis of the loan not being 12 months old. It's my understanding after briefly doing research the 12 month period is invalid and I should have been awarded a loan modification which would have prevented me from losing my home. I have been homeless since the foreclosure and have suffered emotional distress, damages, and have lost time which is of course the most valuable resource. I'd also like to point out I've never been married, and was hospitalized during the notices. I used an attorney provided by the loan originators and used my passport and license which state XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX. I followed what I was told by the attorney present who should have been looking out for my best interest as the consumer rather than the banks. I can prove they have done this on a broad scale.

Re : EverBank loan # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, FL. XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA. XXXX Dear Processor, 1- We ( me and my husband ) filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX, and was confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX, and a plan was established for the payments to be made to the creditors. 2- One of the creditors was/is EverBank ( EB ), and since the said property was a rental at that time, the judge ordered the mortgage payments that were skipped during the BK filing, to be paid back in full. Hence, we made the past due payments accordingly in the amount of {$46000.00} ( see Exh. # 1 ). 3- Since the said loan was modified, the judge decided that the mortgage payments of this loan ( we had several mortgages that were modified to fit the BK plan, except the said loan ) to be paid according to the modification terms.
4- We had also a secured credit line with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was modified by the BK court to be paid over ten years with fixed monthly payments. 5- The attorney representing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the credit line holder ), refused to approve the BK courts payment plan, unless we pay back and bring current whatever we owe to EverBank ( see Exhibit # 2 ) 6- On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an Escrow payment analysis from EverBank telling us also how much our payments would be. We Paid the Mortgage payment via phone, and got confirmation # of XXXX ( see Exh. # 3 ). 
7- Prior to the final confirmation of the BK courts payment plan in XX/XX/XXXX ), EBs attorney requested additional past due amounts ( for five months ) to finalize the plan. We sent a cashiers check in the amount of {$15000.00}, and an additional monthly payment of {$2800.00} ( see exh. # 4 ) 8- On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a new mortgage statement ( Exh # 5 ), requesting in addition to the mortgage payment of {$3100.00} a lump sum payment of {$23000.00} of which {$1300.00} goes to fees + charges, and totaling {$26000.00} 9- We immediately contacted our BK attorney questioning this {$23000.00}. According to him we were not supposed to owe EB any arrearage. 10-For more than 18 months, EverBank refused to talk to us in regard this past due amount that we owe them, claiming that this is a BK case, and we must tell our BK attorney to contact them, and they will resolve it with him. 11-Eventually, and after about two years, they accepted to communicate with us, and assigned a customer relationship manager -XXXX XXXX-to handle the case. We send the above-mentioned evidence to her, and requested from her to pin point the months that we were delinquent so that we can compare them with our records, and if we were delinquent, then we will pay that amount we owe them. They claimed that it should be reflected on our monthly mortgage statements. I am attaching here several mortgage statements, and our bank statements that shows we paid all their mentioned delinquent months ( see exh. # 6 ) 12-We have been making the regular mortgage payments till XX/XX/XXXX, and our last 2 mortgage payments ( XX/XX/XXXX + XX/XX/XXXX see Exh. # 7 ) ) were returned to us, claiming that we are supposed to pay back the whole delinquent amount that was increased to about {$30000.00}. 13-For about 3 months, we kept going back and forth with no avail, and they filed Notice of Default and started the foreclosure process in XX/XX/XXXX. For the next 4 months, we continued to discuss our case with EB, and most of the time either the relationship manager was no longer with EB, or a new one was appointed to our case, which made us repeat the scenario more than 8 times ( we have changed round 8 relationship managers and here are their names-XXXX XXXX- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Eventually one of them suggested to apply for loan modification ( which my husband refused to do, and argued with them saying that we made your regular payments for 28 months, and we can continue making the same payments, why then we should modify the loan, since we have only 18 yrs to pay it off ).
14-Eventually, I agreed to apply for loan modification, for which we were eligible, but they denied the modification without a solid or legitimate reason, we appealed the denial, and filed again proving to them that they made a big mistake in calculating our income, our second application was denied also claiming also that there were missing docs, and every time they requested a document was sent to them immediately, then another relationship manager comes, and claims that there are missing docs. ( see EXH # 8 & 9- We can send you the modification application if necessary ).
XX/XX/XXXX, my husband sold one of his properties, and when he received the payoff demand from the servicer ( XXXX ), he noticed that, the payoff amount is about {$90000.00} more than the original loan amount. He contacted the BK attorney questioning about the figures, the attorney told him that XXXX DID NOT ADHERE TO OR COMPLY with the BK approved plan, and they ( XXXX ) went by their own books, and he sent the court dockets that showed what was the agreement between each lender and us. 15-According to the agreement ( see Exh. # 10 ) EverBank was supposed to request a payment of {$350.00} ( for 60 months ) in addition to the regular mortgage payments, and not {$26000.00}. They didnt honor the court decision, and their own attorneys agreement. 16-If you calculate the pre-petition amount of {$20000.00}, and the post-petition amount of {$18000.00}, and compare that with the amounts in ( Exh. # 1 ) that we paid to EB add to that an escrow surplus in the amount of approximately {$5200.00} that they owe us you will notice that we even overpaid them, cause as I indicated previously, the attorney for the credit line didnt agree to the BK payment plan, unless the delinquent amounts to EB were satisfied.
At this time, I am seeking your assistance in this mater, by negotiating a favorable deal and payment plan with EverBank or XXXX, and keep the house which is scheduled to foreclose in XX/XX/XXXX. Thank you in advance for your consideration and cooperation. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX.",,"TIAA, FSB",CA,913XX,,Consent provided,Web,2017-07-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2581554

I contacted Citi 's customer service and provided my case number and spoke with a claims adjuster named XXXX on XX/XX/18 at XXXX XXXX est. She told me my timestamped screenshot of the advertisement was not valid and could not substantiated at the store. This was a clear tactic Citi uses because I was familiar with their usual runarounds in trying to deny my previous claims with correct and valid documentation. 

To provide greater background, I have had the same issue with the Citi Price Rewind program last year to the month coincidentally and they provided the same baseless reasons in order to deny my claim by providing false details and interpreting their clear-cut terms and conditions in a fickle manner. The claims were eventually approved through CFPB as did my all my other claims from other times using this type of advertisement. 

XXXX promised me she would call me back that night and does not but eventually does on the following day at XXXX est on XX/XX/18 at a time I explicitly told her I would be busy at work. 

In the call she reiterates that she verified with the store and provides me with a current XX/XX/18 current item pricing to which I doubt because I verified with the store and the information I received conflicts with what I received from XXXX. Additionally, the information she provides is irrelevant because I am not submitting an advertisement for XX/XX/18 but in fact it was dated on XX/XX/18 and this information was valid and in stock at the time.

However I had administered her estate and all if her assets had been distributed before I became aware that this banking account existed. By the time i became aware of the Capital One account, the estate had been discharged. I was advised to provide them a court order reflecting that I was in fact the personal representative, a copy of her death certificate and a direction to pay letter advising how I wanted the funds distributed. I provided all three. I specificlly requested that they issue the check to me as there was no longer an estate. At no time would Capital One disclose either the account number or the amount of funds contained within it. A week later I recieved a call advising my request was denied because they would not issue the check to me without a "" Small Estate Affidavit '' and another direction to pay letter. At that time I advised them that Florida, the state of my mother 's residence and closed estate, did not recognize a Small Estate Affidavit. I was told the check would not be released to me without one, so I prepared a notarized "" Small Estate Form '' and a new Direction to Pay letter requesting the funds be sent to me as the personal representative and heir of my mother 's estate.

I stated that in no form or fashion that I am admitting to the debt that is trying to be collected, I am simply trying to make a settlement payment and not payment arrangements because it is not my debt but being reported on my credit report. The operations  manager stated (    XXXX   XXXX    ) th at this debt is in a non-collection status. He stated that in order for me to make a  one time  settlement payment I had to state that "" I was not disputing this debt ''. I stated on a recorded line that "" I am not admitting to this debt in no form or fashion and I am simply stating that I am willing to make a good faith payment for the account that is not mines to be removed '' .Even though   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   purchased the debt from   XXXX   XXXX  , when I contacted   XXXX   XXXX   they stated I do not ow the debt to them. I have nothing to do with this company purchase,   XXXX   XXXX   stated I do not owe the debt to them so I am disputing the debt with this company as debt that is not mines. This debt can not be validated with copies of statements there is NO CONTRACT/ AGREEMENT with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   FOR THE AMOUNT BEING STATED THAT IS OWED.   If the debt that is being reported in a non-collection status with the company that is reporting to the credit bureau then why is it being reported on my credit report and if this debt was not validated by the credit reporting agency then it should not be reported by the credit bureau. There was no contract sent to me that was signed by be from the credit bureau from the comp any (    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    stating that I owe money that was being reported as my debt ) on the credit report it states : Disputed, resolved, consumer disagrees. If this debt was resolved then why is the operati ons manager from    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   stating that it is in a "" non -collection '' status and the credit bureau is currently reporting it as my debt. You say that you have reinvestigated these accounts but youve admitted that all you have done is parroted information given to you by other sources and shifted the burden back to me to contact the original creditor to verify these accounts which is clearly in violati on of 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ).    I also asked you to give me the name of the person in your company who verified the accuracy of these accounts but you ignored this request as well which is another violati on of Federal Law and evi dence of your willful disregard of the law.   your company must be willing and able to produce a document in your files that proves th e account ( s ) in dispute belong to me and the information being reported is accurate and you must be able to do this in a court of law if I file a lawsuit against you. Someone in your company must authenticate the documents in your files that were used to verify the disputed accounts and to do this they must have 1st hand knowledge of the alleged account ( s ) and all that has ever transpired for the alleged account ( s ), under oath and under the penalty of perjury. As I am sure that you are well aware, current Federal case law states that, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from other sources. The Courts have also ordered that a Reinvestigation that merely shifts the burden back to the consumer and the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). You have ignored my request to provided me with the documents that you have in your files that you used to verify the disputed accounts which means that you have NOT verified or you can not verify any of these accounts and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

1173786,2016-12-29,Prepaid card,General purpose card,Fraud or scam,,"On Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a call at my business saying that it was the gas company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They said that I had an overdue balance of {$490.00} and that I had to pay it immediately or my gas service would be disconnected, and my business depends 100 % on gas. They told me to purchase a prepaid card with the amount due on it ( {$490.00} ), and that when I got it they would give me instructions on how to give them the card information in order to avoid having my gas service disconnected. And I did so. I purchased a card called Reloadit with the amount off {$490.00} on it from the XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX. But a few hours later I realized that the gas companys ( XXXX XXXX ) offices arent open on Saturdays, and that I had been a victim of fraud. 
I called Reloadit to see if I could cancel the payment process to the person who defrauded me, and it appeared that I had called in time to cancel the payment. 
The Reloadit representatives gave me a case confirmation number : XXXX. 
Three days later, a woman named XXXX called me from XXXX to give me a new incident number : XXXX. 
Since they hadnt called me back on XXXX XXXX, I called them again, and the representative XXXX gave me another case number ( XXXX ) and told me to send them the proof of purchase for the Reloadit card, plus a copy of the card with the numbers on the back of the card. She told me to send it by fax to XXXX, and I did so. 
They told me that it would take approximately one month to have my money returned. 
On XXXX XXXX I spoke with a man named XXXX, who gave me another case number ( XXXX ). And so it went : month after month I was assisted by different representatives who gave me different case numbers, telling me they were reopening the case, but they never gave me a solution or sent me the money. Ive already spoken with the manager and he hasnt given me the solution for getting back my money either. 

A few months ago I told them that if they didnt send the money, I was going to report them, either to the Better Business Bureau or the CFPB. 
Apparently they dont care. Ive given them several more months, and I still havent received anything. Please help me.

1327958,2016-06-09,Debt collection,Federal student loan,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"After leaving school & subsequently defaulting on my student loans 10 years ago, I recently sought to begin repaying my student debt. Per ed.gov website instructions I contacted student loan manager at the school holding the debt on my Federal Perkins Loan, who then referred me to the collection agency now responsible for resolving the [ XXXX XXXX ] debt. The collection agency in charge of my Perkins Loan insisted that in order to resolve the Perkins Loan [ {$7600.00} ] debt I must "" Consolidate '' all of my [ other ] outstanding defaulted student loans with them. I declined and specifically requested to "" Rehabilitate '' only my defaulted Perkins Loan with this agency now in charge of the Perkins Loan debt. The collection agency refused to offer me "" Rehabilitation '' on my Perkins Loan at all, and again insisted that my only option was to "" Consolidate '' the debt. I declined, and that was the end of the conversation. 

Immediately following that phone conversation I emailed the student loan manager at the school and advised her of my concerns that the collection agency was being less than honest about my repayment options, she advised me that although the agent I spoke to was incorrect about my option to "" Rehab '' the loan, the agency was trustworthy. 

One day later the collection agency called me back and I was advised that in order to "" Rehab '' my Perkins Loan I must accept a minimum payment of $ XXXX/month. I declined again as I simply can not afford that payment. 

Again I immediately contacted ( by email ) the student loan manager at the school explaining that I have been out of work for an extended period of time and I can not afford such a high payment, and requested an appeal or other process to reduce what I am being told is a mandatory minimum payment to "" Rehabilitate '' the Loan. The student loan manager emailed me back stating that the collection agency is correct, the minimum payment possible in order to "" Rehab '' my Perkins Loan is $ XXXX/mo. 

I researched the issue of repaying defaulted Perkins Loans on the Dept. of Education website here : XXXX ( page XXXX-XXXX ) and found that the DOE requires schools to offer repayment of defaulted Perkins Loans "" sufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance on the loan within a 10-year repayment period. '' This was directly contradicted to me several times in email & phone conversations that I had with both the collection agency and the university student loan manager. 

Further more, on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website "" Repay Student Debt '' page here : XXXX it states that defaulted Federal Student Loan borrowers `` have the right to set your payments based on how much money you make. Your payments can be as low as {$5.00} per month if you are unemployed or have very little income. Your debt collector is required by law to offer you this income-driven rehabilitation payment plan. '' I realize this ( $ XXXX/month ) policy may not be specific to Perkins Loans. 

My complaint is that a ) the collection agency has been intentionally dishonest regarding my repayment options ; b ) both the collection agency and the university 's student loan manager continue to insist to me, on the phone & by email, that my minimum "" Rehabilitation '' payment must be significantly larger than that indicated by the DOE 's published regulations regarding defaulted Perkins Loans, despite knowing that such payments would cause significant "" hardship for the borrower '' [ me ], and in direct contravention of the DOE guidelines ( see XXXX page XXXX-XXXX ).",Company believes complaint caused principally by actions of third party outside the control or direction of the company,"Account Control Technology, Inc.",CO,802XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1961378

When I asked their customer service representative, the only answer I got is that an invoice was sent to me, once, in XXXX. And with that, they assumed I was a bad payer ( even knowing that I paid all XXXX monthly fees on time for the 7 months I had the service. This is absurd. 
They sent my debt for collection to ATG Credit. After chatting with XXXX 's customer service representative, I then immediately called ATG Credit and paid for the pending XXXX {$49.00}. I also queried ATG 's customer service representative about their having to notify me before hitting my credit file with an open collection account. They claim they also sent me a letter. I never got this either. I honestly doubt any letter was sent. Again, I would never ignore or fail paying any open debt I knew I had. I have virtually no debt. I carry no credit card balances ( I pay all balances monthly ) and have XXXX leases I pay religiously every month. 
After the collections account was sent to Equifax, my credit was hit by XXXX points because of that. This is not fair. I can not pay a debt I never knew I had. 
Now I am shopping for a home and was looking for alternatives to get a mortgage. These XXXX points can considerably increase the financial cost of a mortgage loan.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"ATG Credit, LLC",FL,,,Consent provided,Web,2015-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1691834

This debt was related to a deposit account I had with this organization. I noticed the debt reporting to my credit files and disputed the information. I was quickly advised in writing from XXXX XXXX of this debt. I made a call to XXXX XXXX this morning XXXX/XXXX/2016 to advise them of my intention to pay this debt for {$78.00}. They had advised me this account was placed with a company called Monterey Financial based out of California. 

I contacted Monterey Financial when they opened this morning ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and was advised for my account number with them and that my balance is not {$78.00} but {$120.00}. I argued stating that XXXX states it to be {$78.00} and that is what they are reporting. They stated that the account was placed with them for collections over 3 years ago. They had very old contact information and had no way of getting in touch with me. They stated they last attempted to reach me on XXXX/XXXX/2016 with no luck as again the information they had was almost XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

After going back and forth with their Agent XXXX XXXX XXXX. I decided I was getting no where. So I contacted XXXX again and they informed me that anything they would be charging would be their fees or accumulated interest on my original debt. 

To the best of my knowledge the FDCPA expressly forbids this. As a consumer I am not required to pay any unauthorized charges such as interest rates, fees, or other charges. XXXX also advised me on this call that only the amount of {$78.00} would be sent to them. I called back Monterey Financial and they advised me that the total amount of interest was billed at XXXX cents/day. This brought my balance to {$100.00} and they were charging a {$20.00} processing fee to handle my payment. They also advised me that they total amount of {$100.00} would be sent to XXXX and they only collect the {$20.00} for the payment fee. 

As far as I can tell I am paying an unlawful 10 % interest on a {$78.00} debt to capcom fcu and an unlawful {$20.00} payment processing fee to Monterey Financial. 

I made this payment because I am attempting get approved for a mortgage and was advised this could potentially hinder me. After making this payment I quickly researched and realized that I may have been charged undue interest and payment fees on behalf of XXXX and Monterey Financial.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,Monterey Financial Services LLC,NY,121XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-03-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1832272

67492,2019-09-13,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am submitting this complaint directly to you because CFPB has direct oversight over the Credit Reporting Agencies. XXXX, Transunion, and XXXX have allowed a charged-off account scheduled for automatic removal XX/XX/XXXX to remain on my credit report past the 7-year deadline governed by FCRA 605. XXXX XXXX  XXXX unlawfully re-aged this charged-off account # XXXX to estimated month and year of XX/XX/XXXX. 
This debt is from my XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, opened XXXX, expiration date XX/XX/XXXX. The charged-off and closed date of the account is documented on my credit report as XX/XX/XXXX. I am aware that XXXX as the original creditor does not appear once the account is charged-off and closed because the debt was sold to a collection agency. XXXX XXXX  XXXX is the new debt owner. I made some payments to XXXX. This payment activity does not constitute a new debt and change the original charge-off date by the original lender. It is incontestably a continuation of the original debt. Federal law requires collection agencies to carry over the original delinquency date so that any collection account is deleted at the same time of the 7-year period charged-off account. It is a violation of law for a collection agency to report and treat a charged-off and closed account as newer. XXXX added a second charge off date of XX/XX/XXXX to make the charge-off appear more recent. In XXXX, I disputed this information with Transunion via phone, stating XXXX intentional re-aging this account and referred to the original creditors charged-off date of XX/XX/XXXX listed on my credit report. Transunion contacted XXXX and XXXX verified the information. I made an additional call back to Transunion to rebut the verified information and again referred to the original charge-off date of XX/XX/XXXX. Transunion advised me that only the creditor could remove this from my report. FCRA 605 holds the Credit Reporting Agencies and the creditors responsible for complying with the law, but that law has been defiled. I do not intend to engage more of my time with the other two reporting agencies while my credit report continues to be damaged, knowing my efforts would generate the same result as with Transunion. I do not intend to engage any time with XXXX XXXX XXXX because of the they have recertified outright deceptive information as of XX/XX/XXXX. Further, XXXX XXXX   XXXX is reporting a second charged off date of XX/XX/XXXX. This malicious, illegal reporting has caused me immeasurable injury. 

American consumers deserve to be protected by the FCRA 605 law, and should not have to deal with the irresponsible reporting concomitant with automatic removal of charged-off and closed accounts. Creditors should be prohibited from submitting re-aged information to the CRAs that extends the 7-year period. Per FCRA 605. Requirements relating to information contained in consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c ] ( a ) Information excluded from consumer reports. Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) of this section, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : ( 4 ) Accounts placed for collection or charged to profit and loss which antedate the report by more than seven years.

Cavarly claimed because my name was listed as payable upon death that they thought the account was mine even though the XXXX XXXX XXXX advised them otherwise. Then later on I had a account at XXXX XXXX XXXX one day it was just negative {$50.00} because they had seized all of my direct deposit paycheck from the day before and the bank charged me for the transaction.

I was told by my bank that there is nothing they could do on their end because they don't know who it was coming from being that it was a email or mobile transfer. The agent even joked saying its free money go ahead and spend it because there's nothing they could do about it. I was the agent to block whoever it is coming from so that the issue doesn't persist and to file a claim. After this I was under the impression that this issue was rectified not knowing that this person was still sending me money on a monthly basis totaling {$800.00} after a year. I was contacted by the claims department because someone filed a claim because they have been sending money to the wrong person. I explained what has been going on to the agent doing the claim and she said that she would contact me but none did. The bank went ahead and took {$800.00} out of my account leaving me overdraft without notifying me or getting permission. The agent noted that I gave her permission to take the money out because I do not know the sender and we did not have that conversation. after I told her the situation, I was told that she will contact me back. when I called multiple times they were rude and not trying to hear out the situation. The last lady informed me that I should have been aware of this and not spend the money and I called last year to file a fraud claim which was denied because I cant file a fraud claim for receiving money even if it is from someone I don't know. I told her that I wasn't aware that the claim got denied and I was not aware that this person was still putting money in my account in small amounts monthly, she insisted that I should have paid attention and not spend the money and hung up.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-01-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2798060

The dealer replaced everything from the crank up in the motor without figuring out why it went. This roughly cost 3500 dollars in parts and labor for yamaha i would assume. The dealer ran it around the building numerous times etc and i got it back in reasonable time. With all brand new parts the motor came apart again not even 150 miles later.. The dealer has pulled apart engine and wants to replace oil pump along with all new parts again but yamaha is refusing to cover the machine with over 2 years of warranty left. its clear that the machine has a lubrication issue within the motor yet are claiming this is all my fault. They went as far as offering me one part as good will and than sent me a cheesy sticker package in the mail. I still owe an outrageous amount of money on something i ca n't use. I had to cancel hunting trips etc and am still making all payments. The dealer has made numerous calls to Yamaha motors corporation only to have my claim denied time and time again. I have spent lots of my time on the phone and can not get any answers from the company. a person name XXXX with customer service has denied my claims and wo n't give me a direct answer about covering the machine.
