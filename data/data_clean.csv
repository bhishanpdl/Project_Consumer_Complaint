Mortgage,"Hello : ditech.com is my mortgage company. They placed an automatic forbearance on my account and removed my auto payment after Hurricane Irma. I called about a week after the storm to ask that they remove the forbearance and return the auto payment. This was confirm by the agent and recorded by them. I received a letter just a few weeks ago stating that my auto payment was never returned and the agent who I spoke with after I received the letter actually read back the notes confirming that I called and asked to have forbearance removed and auto payment reinstated. So I asked again the agent to remove the forbearance and install auto payment. 

I called this past week to check if this was done yet, and the agent at that time said I still have a forbearance and no auto payment. 

As I right this complaint, I spoke with an agent today that informs me that I dont have auto payment and forbearance is still active. She placed me on hold, which has lasted an hour. 

Ditech is not responsive, and it is purposely choosing to keep my in forbearance when I have asked countless times to remove me. I also have asked countless times to reinstate auto payment and yet they choose not to listen.

Mortgage,"A customer service agent from  Ocwen  Mortgage presumably in the  XXXX  called me and advised me that I needed to pay {$240.00} to reinstate the mortgage.

I had too not pay on another bill for home needs. 
Then I started getting emails that my credit score had been changed and that there was activity on it. Which others were trying to keep from happening.

Checking or savings account,"Citi Bank currently offers Banking promotion which states "" deposit XXXX within 30 days of account opening to get {$600.00} bonus ''. The promotion is done online only. Citi bank starts counting the days from the day you file the application online. Although the account gets approved in 3-4 days after application, the consumer CAN NOT LOG INTO account until they get a debit card which may take 2-3 weeks. Citibank requires a DEBIT CARD to be Handy to Activate the Account. Without a debit card, the consumer can not ACTIVATE THE ACCOUNT. Infact citibank will not even issue your account number without debit card activation. Hence the consumer is already at a narrow window and only gets 1 week time to deposit the money. In my case, Citibank never sent me a debit card or it got lost in the mail. They resend me the card and hence I already passed the deposit window. Because of this, Citibank states that I am not eligible for the bonus when in fact it was no fault of mine.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been disputing and requesting validation of a debt I do not owe for nearly 4 months now and EXPERIAN has not only been evasive, they have never once provided the requested and official documentation required by law, in reference to the following accounts. IN ADDITION THE OTHER XXXX BUREAUS XXXX AND XXXX HAVE ALREADY REMOVED THE ITEM in question, so it appears EXPERIAN wants to play by their own rules. The item on my credit report XXXX acct # : XXXX is falsely showing. Not once have they provided me valid proof that it was mine NOR that I had a contract with either of these company. Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g ( Sec. 809 ) that the claim that I owe them is not valid, and that I requested validation, and additionally I demanded proof of this debt, specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature, as well as proof of their authority in this matter. Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine. 

I have repeatedly asked them to provide the following, below ( items XXXX ) but would not disclose how they got any of my information in the XXXX place : 1. Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. 2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information? 3. What is your authorization of law for your collection of this alleged debt? 4. Please evidence your authorization to do business or operate in this state. 5. Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 6. Please provide a complete account history, including any charges added for collection activity. This type of practice is not only upsetting but the authority and power these people have over other consumers presumably is also very illegal. They obviously are not willing to provide this which is even further illegal.

BUT AFTER EXAMINING MY REPORT TODAY, I STILL SEE THAT THERE IS A BUNCH OF FRAUDULENT INFORMATION STILL APPEARING IN MY CREDIT REPORTS FROM ALL 3 MAJOR CREDIT BUREAUS ( XXXX, XXXX   TRANSUNION ). THIS FRAUDULENT INFORMATION INCLUDES CLOSED ACCOUNTS, COLLECTIONS ACCOUNTS, WRONG NAME, S WRONG EMPLOYERS, WRONG ADDRESSES AND INQUIRIES. I WILL LIKE ALL THE CREDIT BUREAUS TO REMOVE AND BLOCK THIS INFORMATION FROM APPEARING ON MY CREDIT REPORT AGAIN. IF NOT ALREADY ON MY REPORT I WILL LIKE AN EXTENDED FRAUD ALERT TO BE ADDED ON MY REPORT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THESE ACCOUNTS BELONG TO AND I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANY OF THE COMPANIES LISTED IN THIS REPORT AND IN MY FTC AFFIDAVIT REPORT.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2020, I entered the XXXX XXXX XXXX website to book two hotel rooms. Those hotel rooms totaled a purchase of {$540.00}. In my "" Summary of Charges '' the XXXX site indicated "" Get the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card and receive a {$250.00} statement credit after first purchase ''. Initially I thought, "" Ok, well they'll credit me if i purchase something later, I'll pass. '' But then to the right of this there is a breakdown of charges that displays the stay total of {$540.00} less a {$250.00} statement credit, equaling {$290.00} Total after statement credit. I then thought, "" No, this will obviously count as my first purchase, according to my summary of charges I'll receive the credit towards this first purchase, what a deal .... ''. I'll also point out that this rate was for a Bonvoy Rewards member which the advertisement indicated i would automatically be enrolled in after credit card approval. I then proceed to move forward with the application, I was approved and then suddenly the next screen indicated there was an error and I could not move forward. So now, I have no way of completing the reservation, no rewards member info to book the room at the discounted rate and no way to purchase the booking with the card XXXX just encouraged me to apply for with their wonderful statement credit. So I call the number associated with XXXX and they tell me there's nothing they can do, I'll need to call Chase. I call Chase and that's when they advise that no, you can't book your stay with your new account so that you can receive the credit we've just promised you through our deceptive marketing and no we're not sure how you book on your existing credit card to receive the reward member rate. I ask for a supervisor and am transferred to XXXX an Account Supervisor who I respectfully requested two things. To immediately close my account which she obliged. Secondly, to have the credit inquiry removed from my credit report through all three of the credit bureaus since that inquiry was the result of their coordinated and deceptive marketing with XXXX. She advised she could not. I then asked her if Chase has an executive complaint office that I could be forwarded to and again she advised no.",3,"['xx', 'entered', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'website', 'bok', 'two', 'hotel', 'rom', 'hotel', 'rom', 'totaled', 'purchase', 'sumary', 'charge', 'xx', 'site', 'indicated', 'get', 'mariot', 'bonvoy', 'boundles', 'credit', 'card', 'receive', 'statement', 'credit', 'first', 'purchase', 'initialy', 'thought', 'ok', 'wel', 'theyl', 'credit', 'purchase', 'something', 'later', 'il', 'pa', 'right', 'breakdown', 'charge', 'display', 'stay', 'total', 'le', 'statement', 'credit', 'equaling', 'total', 'statement', 'credit', 'thought', 'wil', 'obviously', 'count', 'first', 'purchase', 'acording', 'sumary', 'charge', 'il', 'receive', 'credit', 'towards', 'first', 'purchase', 'deal', 'il', 'also', 'point', 'rate', 'bonvoy', 'reward', 'member', 'advertisement', 'indicated', 'would', 'automaticaly', 'enroled', 'credit', 'card', 'aproval', 'proced', 'move', 'forward', 'aplication', 'aproved', 'sudenly', 'next', 'scren', 'indicated', 'eror', 'could', 'move', 'forward', 'way', 'completing', 'reservation', 'reward', 'member', 'info', 'bok', 'rom', 'discounted', 'rate', 'way', 'purchase', 'boking', 'card', 'xx', 'encouraged', 'aply', 'wonderful', 'statement', 'credit', 'cal', 'number', 'asociated', 'xx', 'tel', 'there', 'nothing', 'il', 'ned', 'cal', 'chase', 'cal', 'chase', 'advise', 'bok', 'stay', 'new', 'acount', 'receive', 'credit', 'weve', 'promised', 'deceptive', 'marketing', 'sure', 'bok', 'existing', 'credit', 'card', 'receive', 'reward', 'member', 'rate', 'ask', 'supervisor', 'transfered', 'xx', 'acount', 'supervisor', 'respectfuly', 'requested', 'two', 'thing', 'imediately', 'close', 'acount', 'obliged', 'secondly', 'credit', 'inquiry', 'removed', 'credit', 'report', 'al', 'thre', 'credit', 'bureau', 'since', 'inquiry', 'result', 'cordinated', 'deceptive', 'marketing', 'xx', 'advised', 'could', 'asked', 'chase', 'executive', 'complaint', 'ofice', 'could', 'forwarded', 'advised']",xx entered xx xx xx website bok two hotel rom hotel rom totaled purchase sumary charge xx site indicated get mariot bonvoy boundles credit card receive statement credit first purchase initialy thought ok wel theyl credit purchase something later il pa right breakdown charge display stay total le statement credit equaling total statement credit thought wil obviously count first purchase acording sumary charge il receive credit towards first purchase deal il also point rate bonvoy reward member advertisement indicated would automaticaly enroled credit card aproval proced move forward aplication aproved sudenly next scren indicated eror could move forward way completing reservation reward member info bok rom discounted rate way purchase boking card xx encouraged aply wonderful statement credit cal number asociated xx tel there nothing il ned cal chase cal chase advise bok stay new acount receive credit weve promised deceptive marketing sure bok existing credit card receive reward member rate ask supervisor transfered xx acount supervisor respectfuly requested two thing imediately close acount obliged secondly credit inquiry removed credit report al thre credit bureau since inquiry result cordinated deceptive marketing xx advised could asked chase executive complaint ofice could forwarded advised

Debt collection,"The Debt you are attempting to collect as a 3rd Party Debt Collector in questionable under current Federal monetary laws.

These parties include : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX  XXXX. 

What this should tell you, my initial arguments disputing this debt with you organization hold validity. Enough so, the prospect of reduced company valuation, adding definition to the identified monetary policy loops holes in the FCRA, or debt validation determining the validity of future collection potential as defined by the IRS and Treasury department that will impact the future of your industry. These factors represented enough risk to cease all collection efforts by the parties mentioned above. 

Your collection attempt represents less this .03 % of 1 % of the debt I formerly held before this began in XX/XX/XXXX of this year. I am asking once again the collection item be removed with a mutual understanding no further actions will be taken on my part. 
If true valuation occurred, it would be discovered I am monetarily exempt and earning under the federal poverty limit. I am preparing to cost your organization far more than the amount in active collection.

Mortgage,Ocwen is making loan agreements without all parties involved consent. They refuse to provide me information on the loan that they hold me liable for. I am co-borrower and co-owner of a property w/ ex-husband who is in Chapter XXXX in CA.

Ocwen will not release any information of the agreement to me or update me on the status of the loan. I have not consented nor will I consent to any forbearance or modification agreement that does n't release my liability. Ocwen states I am liable for the loan but refuses to release any information about the loan to me ( they send letters to the credit agency about how late I am every month ). It is a {$700000.00} loan. They wo n't give me any information about the loan unless my ex-husband 's attorney sends a letter ( which he wo n't do ). There are no court orders stating I am not to get access. I have asked that all correspondences are sent to both parties on the loan countless times without success.

Student loan,"Over the years, by Nelnet, I was guided to forbearance without a clear understanding of the consequences of interest capitalization. I was told that my loan is simple interest. Even though I am financially prudent and astute, the true meaning of interest capitalization just became clear. 

My credit score went down 50 points from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, because my student loan debt increased. When I contacted Nelnet today, XX/XX/XXXX, for the first time, interest capitalization was clearly explained. Interest capitalization is the reason my loan debt increased, and my credit score decreased by 50 points. 

Also, Nelnet lost my Loan Forgiveness application for {$17.00}, XXXX. The forgiveness process, including when the application was lost and resubmitted, took from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet accrued and capitalized interest during the time the application was lost and while the forgiveness process completed. A Nelnet adviser said today, XX/XX/XXXX that interest accrues at {$4.00} a day so for the approximately 6 months the process took from submission, being lost, and processed the accrued interest is approximately {$830.00}. 

Furthermore, I received two almost identical letters regarding a single forbearance. One letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX and the other XX/XX/XXXX. The 1st letter said the estimated interest to accrue was {$.00}. The second letter said accrued interest was {$4900.00}. Scanned copies are attached. 

Additionally, on XX/XX/XXXX, a Nelnet adviser said that my 10 year loan repayment was {$170.00}. After checking my account today, XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that the payment term is 233 months instead of 120 months, is {$190.00} instead of {$170.00}, and I could pay more than {$20000.00} interest on a {$25000.00} debt. 

I need to make much higher payments to avoid further interest capitalization financial damage.

Mortgage,"We purchased our home in XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX financing, which, of course, required PMI. Since then, the home has gone up considerably in market value, which, when combined with XXXX plus years of principle reduction, brings us well below the requisite XXXX threshold of XXXX % XXXX to drop the PMI. Per XXXX regs, a new appraisal was required. The servicer, XXXX, through its appraisal management XXXX, sent out the same XXXX who had done the original purchase appraisal. The ensuing appraisal report was chock full of errors, omissions and misstatements of material facts, some of which are a matter of public record, falsified his XXXX certifications, used non-comparable sales data while failing to note significant comparable sales data relative to our house. It is compelling and illustrative of the depth of this XXXX 's XXXX, lack of professionalism and failure to exercise ordinary care. Each appraisal done on our home by this same XXXX contains different and conflicting information. As a result, based on garbage in/garbage out XXXX, the ensuing report grossly understated the value of our home and XXXX denied dropping the PMI. We contacted XXXX to dispute the appraisal and wrote a letter of dispute, supported by additional documentation pointing out the erroneous information and omissions on the appraisal report, the fact that the XXXX has a vested interest ( he is also a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in influencing values as well as additional timely comparable sales data ignored by the XXXX which support a market value significantly greater than the falsely arrived at value issued by the XXXX. We, again, requested dropping the PMI. XXXX chose to blatantly disregard the factual and supportive sales data we submitted and again declined our request to drop PMI. Factual errors, omissions and wrongful assumptions and data on the original appraisal report were NOT corrected. They also declined our very specific request to provide detail of who, precisely, was to have performed the so-called "" review. '' IT IS PATENTLY WRONG THAT WE, AS CONSUMERS, SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT A DECISION BY THIS LENDER/SERVICER BASED ON A PROVEN ERRONEOUS REPORT. We then sent a certified letter to head of the operations group at XXXX demanding that fresh eyes, higher up the ladder, review this case and approve our request to drop the PMI. Copy of that letter is attached to this complaint. We have not received any response from XXXX since.

I have not authorized this company to disseminate, expose, publish or give my information to anyone, there is no legal document that I have signed between them and myself, so I do not see why they can disseminate my personal wrong information where my record, reputation, and prestige are damaged, where there is a law that can manipulate personal information for profit to increase sales and credit interests for the economic benefit of others, this is unjustifiable, abusive and illegal, so I demand that this dispute for account information from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX Child Support, I've never had a delay or ever stop paying there is no reason to have it in collection and delinquency.

Mortgage,"XXXX holds my mortgage loan. They process payments through a company called Loan Care, LLC. I bought my first house in XXXX, 2016. First mortgage payment, processed through XXXX Loan Care worked fine in XXXX. I immediately set up autodraft for my loan payments with this successful info. In XXXX, payment did not go through, so I contacted XXXX Loan Care via phone. They instructed me to use the number on the bottom of my checks as the "" account number '' to list on their online form. I did as instructed, received confirmation of payment ( always from LoanCare, occasionally also from XXXX ), and assumed all was fine. Weeks later I received a letter in the mail informing me my payment was not received, and I am now late. I contact XXXX Loan Care again, numerous times to try and resolve, even changing which bank I was using to pull the payment from. Despite making payments with a Loan Care representative on the phone, my payments have still not gone through. When I contacted XXXX to help resolve the issue, I was ignored or run in circles with XXXX Loan Care. I have now been reported as having outstanding late payments on my credit report, which XXXX refuses to take any action to remedy, despite the fact that the only reason I was late is due to misinformation provided to me by their payment processing company. Representatives at XXXX have also sent emails containing ALL of my bank account numbers, causing serious security concerns. The reps at XXXX have been untruthful, dismissive, and damaging to my character and my credit. They have taken to simply ignoring my emails. My credit is being destroyed because of a single late payment which was ONLY late because the processing company gave me bad instructions, and then failed to notify me in anything resembling a timely manner. 

Attempts to pay- XXXX web payment- XXXX/XXXX/16 - successful ( set up autodraft with this info ) XXXX web payment- XXXX - failed - Confirmed successful via email by both companies Contact XXXXLoanCare XXXX - change autodraft to what XXXX Loan Care employee tells me to change it to XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed XXXX + XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed, - Confirmed successful via email by both companies. 

Contact XXXXLoanCare XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed XXXX + XXXX phone pay with rep- XXXX - successful -Confirmed via email by both companies XXXX phone pay with rep- XXXX - failed - Confirmed successful via email by both companies XXXX web pay- XXXX - credited to XXXX XXXX - reported to credit bureaus as 30 days late. At this point XXXX is the only missing payment, but I had no reason to believe XXXX payment was credited to XXXX, nor reason to believe XXXX was late as the representative from XXXX Loan Care had fully confirmed the payment over the phone. 

XXXX web pay- XXXX - failed XXXX web pay- XXXX -??? 

I have tried to resolve this issue with XXXX Loan Care and through my mortgage company, who employs XXXX Loan Care to process their payments. I have contacted 3 different people at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a half dozen different reps at Loan Care. Neither company has made any attempt at actual resolution. 

I am trying to be responsible. I pay all of my bills on time- there is no reason why I would intentionally not pay my mortgage. The money is sitting in my bank account. The only reason I was late at all was because I was told to use the incorrect information to process my payment, and then not notified in a timely manner when it did n't work. The information Loan Care has reported to the credit bureaus is incorrect, and will reduce my credit rating for years to come ( currently, it 's cost me XXXX points on my credit score ). I 'm a XXXX year old XXXX, I do n't deserve to have my credit ruined because of the lazy, deplorable service of my mortgage company and its payment center.",0,"['xx', 'hold', 'mortgage', 'loan',

Bank account or service,"About 3 weeks ago i posted an art piece i painted on the app offer up. I was asking {$350.00}. I received a message from a buyer saying they wanted to buy the item. We then started emailing back and forth. Via XXXX he sent me a check for the amount of {$1500.00}. Clearly i though it was a mistake but no, the buyer instructed me to deduct XXXX for my cost + XXXX for running around for this transaction XXXX for holding the item. i then went to my bank to deposit the check via drive through bank teller. {$300.00} was available right away so i waited for the following day for the full amount of the check to post. When the next day came i seen that i had the full amount of the check available in my account, i believed that meant the check had cleared ... this is where i be leave I 'm not fully responsible for my bank to charge me. The buyer instructed me to send via XXXX a money transfer to the mover who was to pick up the item. So i went to XXXX and did so using my debit card i made a transfer of {$1000.00} ... i thought this guy must be way out of state. I do have receipts and all documentation of this transaction. So i thought all was well, i waited for the movers to come for the item but they never did.., the buyer then contacted me saying the movers wanted more money to pick up the item because of other pickups they had already done for him so he said he will send me another check and to do the same thing. I then became suspicious ... the following morning i seen i had a negative balance on my bank account. Of over XXXX dollars ... this is when my walls caved in ... i could n't believe it ... the bank told me it was a fraudulent check ... right away i went to my local bank to explain the situation but they said it was my fault and I 'm responsible for that charge ... there was nothing they can do ... i do n't have XXXX dollars lying around ... ... i do n't understand how i was able to make a XXXX dollar transfer using my debit card if the bank had not yet cleared the check ... or why would the full amount of the check show posted on my available balance if it really was n't ... of course at this point the buyer stopped responding to me ... but he still had the audacity to send me XXXX more checks ... i feel the bank is at least XXXX percent at fault ... The only reason why i made the transfer was because i saw the full amount of the check available the day after i deposited ... to me that meant the check was cleared and that 's why i was able to make the money transfer.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I used my Chase credit card ( Cardmember Services ) on XX/XX/2017 to submit initial deposit of {$2500.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX, sister company of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The contract says that the company is only allowed to charge the initial deposit of {$2500.00} to the card ( provided over the phone ). The company charged the entire amount of {$5.00}, XXXX to my account and did not finish the job. Chase asked me to provide documentation indicating that the job was not delivered as promised. I submitted email correspondences to Chase in which the company, XXXX XXXX XXXX abandoned the job and did not complete it. When Chase sent the decision letter, ruling in favor of the merchant, they said that I never submitted a second opinion- which was not requested. I did seek a second opinion and hired XXXX XXXX XXXX to redo the framing that was done by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( it was done incorrectly ) and to frame the rest of the house ( what the first company was paid to do but did not complete ). Additionally, in the first contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was paid {$10000.00} to demolish all of the walls in the house.. this was also not completed. This is the second time that the merchant was paid to complete a job and did not do it. Chase is also claiming that because the contract was not signed there is no proof that XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX was only supposed to charge the initial deposit. If the contract is not signed, then he did not have permission to charge any amount to my account.

Conclusion : contract was not signed, merchant did not have permission to charge {$5000.00} to my Chase Visa card Work done by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was incomplete and faulty. I hired another company to correct and to complete his work.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been upset by the high interest rates and high fees of 3 credit cards I have with US bank in addition to the bank 's sudden drop of my credit limits on one visa. Also, I wish to report the non existent customer service of this bank and the only call center employee who ever answers my calls, XXXX. This self hating man is prejudiced, inflexible, and low spirited. He sounds more like a criminal than a customer service person. Last time I spoke to him was tonight XX/XX/2019 around XXXX. But here I will concentrate on other 3 problems. 1- I learned tonight that US bank is charging me over 25 % for one visa, over % 23 for another, and over % 21 for a third because the bank 's assessment is that I dont have the means to pay my debt! If this is the reasoning, then US bank is made up of psychos who hope with higher interest rates on someone with difficult situation, they make sure the person never meets their obligations. Here I am asking that US bank fires such psychos in the underwriting department and hires people who can help us get lower interest rates such as 5 % so we can pay our bills. The other problem of US bank is that it has charged me several times {$38.00} fees for late payments. I want all of that stolen money returned to me. I have indeed never been late. The problem is that the bank considers central time for the closing of its banks as the cut off time while for me living in CA and other States, its difficult to always remember central time. Just like other banks US bank should follow an exact schedule rather than a confusing cut off time. Additionally, in or around XXXX to XX/XX/2019, the bank had a failing website. For example, in XXXX I had completed my payments on the site but later I found out the site wasnt working and my payments never went through. So I was charged {$38.00} and the belligerent call center men in Idaho denied me the return of my dollars even if I had proof of how i was mislead by the site. The third complaint is about the belligerent treatment I received from US bank underwriters who reduced the credit limit of one of  my visas and hiked my interest rates from already high % 17 to higher % 21-25. The  real reason for this increase was that shortly before I had called a phone number on TV promising to help consumers lower their credit card interest rates! Although the phone call was purely informational, and I never intended to hire that company, the US bank acted in retaliation by reducing my credit limit and raising my interest rates. The unethical behavior of US bank employees has disgusted me especially their rudeness to disregard my appeal. Last but not the least, Im asking the company to diversify its customer service to beyond Idaho and prejudiced self hating men in call centers. There are many good people all over US who need jobs and US bank could do much better.",3,"['ben', 'upset', 'high', 'interest', 'rate', 'high', 'fe', 'credit', 'card', 'u', 'bank', 'adition', 'bank', 'suden', 'drop', 'credit', 'limit', 'one', 'visa', 'also', 'wish', 'report', 'non', 'existent', 'customer', 'service', 'bank', 'cal', 'center', 'employe', 'ever', 'answer', 'cals', 'xx', 'self', 'hating', 'man', 'prejudiced', 'inflexible', 'low', 'spirited', 'sound', 'like', 'criminal', 'customer', 'service', 'person', 'last', 'time', 'spoke', 'tonight', 'xx', 'around', 'xx', 'wil', 'concentrate', 'problem', 'learned', 'tonight', 'u', 'bank', 'charging', 'one', 'visa', 'another', 'third', 'bank', 'asesment', 'dont', 'mean', 'pay', 'debt', 'reasoning', 'u', 'bank', 'made', 'psycho', 'hope', 'higher', 'interest', 'rate', 'someone', 'dificult', 'situation', 'make', 'sure', 'person', 'never', 'mets', 'obligation', 'asking', 'u', 'bank', 'fire', 'psycho', 'underwriting', 'department', 'hire', 'people', 'help', 'u', 'get', 'lower', 'interest', 'rate', 'pay', 'bils', 'problem', 'u', 'bank', 'charged', 'several', 'time', 'fe', 'late', 'payment', 'want', 'al', 'stolen', 'money', 'returned', 'inded', 'never', 'ben', 'late', 'problem', 'bank', 'considers', 'central', 'time', 'closing', 'bank', 'cut', 'time', 'living', 'ca', 'state', 'dificult', 'always', 'rember', 'central', 'time', 'like', 'bank', 'u', 'bank', 'folow', 'exact', 'schedule', 'rather', 'confusing', 'cut', 'time', 'aditionaly', 'around', 'xx', 'xx', 'bank', 'failing', 'website', 'example', 'xx', 'completed', 'payment', 'site', 'later', 'found', 'site', 'wasnt', 'working', 'payment', 'never', 'went', 'charged', 'beligerent', 'cal', 'center', 'men', 'idaho', 'denied', 'return', 'dolars', 'even', 'prof', 'mislead', 'site', 'third', 'complaint', 'beligerent', 'treatment', 'received', 'u', 'bank', 'underwriter', 'reduced', 'credit', 'limit', 'one', 'visa', 'hiked', 'interest', 'rate', 'already', 'high', 'higher', 'real', 'reason', 'increase', 'shortly', 'caled', 'phone', 'number', 'tv', 'promising', 'help', 'consumer', 'lower', 'credit', 'card', 'interest', 'rate', 'although', 'phone', 'cal', 'purely', 'informational', 'never', 'intended', 'hire', 'company', 'u', 'bank', 'acted', 'retaliation', 'reducing', 'credit', 'limit', 'raising', 'interest', 'rate', 'unethical', 'behavior', 'u', 'bank', 'employes', 'disgusted', 'especialy', 'rudenes', 'disregard', 'apeal', 'last', 'least', 'im', 'asking', 'company', 'diversify', 'customer', 'service', 'beyond', 'idaho', 'prejudiced', 'self', 'hating', 'men', 'cal', 'center', 'many', 'god', 'people', 'al', 'u', 'ned', 'job', 'u', 'bank', 'could', 'much', 'beter']",ben upset high interest rate high fe credit card u bank adition bank suden drop credit limit one visa also wish report non existent customer service bank cal center employe ever answer cals xx self hating man prejudiced inflexible low spirited sound like criminal customer service person last time spoke tonight xx around xx wil concentrate problem learned tonight u bank charging one visa another third bank asesment dont mean pay debt reasoning u bank made psycho hope higher interest rate someone dificult situation make sure person never mets obligation asking u bank fire psycho underwriting department hire people help u get lower interest rate pay bils problem u bank charged several time fe late payment want al stolen money returned inded never ben late problem bank considers central time closing bank cut time living ca state dificult always rember central time like bank u bank folow exact schedule rather confusing cut time aditionaly around xx xx bank failing website example xx completed payment site later found site wasnt working payment never went charged beligerent cal center men idaho denied return dolars even prof mislead site third complaint beligerent treatment received u bank underwriter reduced credit limit one visa hiked interest rate already high higher real reason increase shortly caled phone number tv promising help consumer lower credit card interest rate although phone cal purely informational never intended hire company u bank acted retaliation reducing credit limit raising interest rate unethical behavior u bank employes disgusted especialy rudenes disregard apeal last least im asking company diversify customer service beyond idaho prejudiced self hating men cal center many god people al u ned job u bank could much beter
Mortgage,"To Stop collecting PMI 1. I purchased a house in XX/XX/XXXX with 10 % down payment. 
2. The appraisal value was $ XXXX and the selling price was {$150000.00} 3. The Original Amortization Schedule shows as soon as the property reaches 78 % LTV or on XX/XX/XXXX the PMI of {$77.00} should be automaticall terminated as per Home Owner 's Protection Act. 
4. Nationstar mortgage now Mr. Cooper says that it will terminate automatically my PMI on XX/XX/XXXX. 
5. Honble ' Court has given a ruling in similar case of PMI removal that original terms and conditions of the purchase stands good even in case the loan being modified. No appraisal or BPO is required to remove PMI under Automatic Termination Clause. 
6. Now, when I approached Mr. Cooper they say that in XX/XX/XXXX only they will remove the PMI though my 78 % of the LTV reached in XX/XX/XXXX and currently at 70.07 % LTV. 
7. Mr. Cooper and before that Nationstar mortgage can only remove the PMI after reaching 78 % automatically and can not re-calculate the PMI and keep charging me {$22.00} a month. 
8. I dont know under which provision in Home Owner 's Protection Act they can re-calculate after 10 years and charge me {$22.00} PMI every month 9. Nationstar Mortgage should have stopped collecting PMI of {$77.00} as soon as my loan reached under 78 % which is XX/XX/XXXX or atleast should have stopped collecting PMI as per original amortization schedule which is XX/XX/XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have had to exercise my option to defer ( extend ) payments to the end of my loan, in the summer of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX has reported both the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments as over 30 days on my credit, both with XXXX and Trans Union. I contacted XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to dispute the most recent reported late payment. After looking at the situation, they told me the deferment ( extension ) was processed after the payment was 30 days late. I reminded them that I had submitted the proper documentation and the payment to process in time. I called to follow up the next day, after submitting both the paperwork and the payment to ensure everything had been received. Their system was down that day ( Saturday ) and they could not tell me anything until the following week. I was assured it would be effective dated for the receipt date. The person in XX/XX/XXXX told me to file a dispute with the Credit Bureaus. I did that XX/XX/XXXX. The reporting for the XX/XX/XXXX was removed upon the resolution of that dispute. The next month, XX/XX/XXXX was reported again as late. I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to, again, go through the long process of explaining everything to hear the same responses. Finally, a supervisor assured me she was going to review it with the credit reporting team and get back to me the following week. Last Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I finally had time to call to follow up, after getting absolutely no response in over a month. I had to, once again, explain everything to be told the same responses, along with another supervisor telling me what "" I '' would have to do to correct it. I explained in very clear terms, my next action was to file a complaint through CFPB. I asked him the time frame he needed to get a response from the credit reporting team. He said Wednesday, which was XX/XX/XXXX. I have not heard or seen any response. I purposely waited another couple days, in case something came up, preventing a timely response. 

I, now, would like to have both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX removed from my credit report as late payments, since both payments were placed at the end of my loan, causing me to pay additional interest on the loan, and delaying my payoff date. I have spent hours trying to get this corrected. I have been denied a personal loan, because of these reporting issues. That personal loan would have allowed me to pay off the last of the negative issues on my credit, therefore raising my credit score to the point I could effectively trade in the car and have XXXX XXXX paid off.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am a victim of Identity theft. Someone used my information to open an account with Citibank XXXX XXXX. I was alerted to an inquiry by XXXX on XX/XX/ after someone tried to take over my bank account. I immediately called XXXX and was told that the account had been opened. Explained that I did not open the account and it needed to be investigated. Was treated like I was lying by the fraud rep. She told me ( BUT THE ACCOUNT MATCHES YOUR ADDRESS ). Told her that I did not apply for the account and did not want it. She finally told me that They would close the account and investigate. And then they did not provide any kind of claim number or advise further action. Knowing they did not believe my claim I disputed with the major credit Bureaus. 

Around the last part of XX/XX/XXXXI recieved a bill from XXXX for XXXX. I live in XXXX XXXX and all of the Transactions are from XXXX XXXX  Including one fromXX/XX/XXXX The day the account was opened and have proof I was at a XXXX XXXX XXXX location in XXXX that day. Obviously the account was never closed or investigated as told by the fraud department. 

XX/XX/ Received notification from XXXX  that they verified the account as mine and the dispute is closed. 

XX/XX/ XXXX XXXX Placed another Call to the fraud department. Was told there was not an Investigation started on my first call as suspected. The fraud rep did admit That XXXX knew that the account was fraudulent but said they can not remove the account from my credit reports because it has a balance. I said the balance would not be there if they had investigated the first call. She would not tell me a status only that I am paying the price of their employees not doing their Job. 

XX/XX/XXXXWas transferred to the the Account security department and was told that they just recently opened an investigation and had to wait 90 days. Asked why they validated the account as mine with the bureaus and she said that. Even though they know it is fraud the dispute department will still validate the account. I understand that if they know it is fraud they must remove the account and inquiries from my report immediately. She then said they submitted it to be removed and placed all of the blame on the credit bureaus and said I had to give them 60 days to remove it. I explained again that they just verified this a legitimate account when they know it is fraud and that it is against FCRA laws. She again blamed the bureaus. I asked for future status updates and was denied because they don't do that.

Debt collection,"I was a patient at XXXX XXXX in XXXX SC. I was seen numerous times before my XXXX was scheduled. It is XXXX  XXXX  policy that all payment is due before or at time of service. On the day of my XXXX I was given a form to sign stating everything in detail that I owe. I was given a statement of what my insurance was paying and also told that insurance was not a guarantee of payment. However in this case my insurance paid EVERYTHING 100 % that was told and documented to XXXX XXXX. Of particular interest on the copay line for their XXXX center it was listed as XXXX. As I do not have a deductible or copayment with my insurance unless I am using is called an ambulatory XXXX center. As it is not often one has to have XXXX and I am not in the medical field to know the medical jargon. I rely on the patient assistance/financial assistance, and what is written on paper to make my financial decisions as to the place of medical treatment. The last appointment before my XXXX I was asked as to my preference to use XXXX  XXXX center or an affiliated hospital. I advised whatever would be the most affordable option. In my case with my particular situation I would only have been responsible for a small portion of the bill had I used an affiliated hospital. However as you can see on their website they state their center usually saves insurance companies hundreds of dollars and it is clearly advocated to use their XXXX center. After reviewing the document and signing before my XXXX I was told my copay for this facility in which the XXXX was performed would be XXXX. This is a simple oversight on XXXX  XXXX. I was told I was paid in full less than a week later. To verify I logged into XXXX  XXXX  online payment portal to verify I had a zero balance. A month later I received a bill for {$480.00}. As soon as time permitted I called and spoke with the head of the financial department and she said she was unsure why I had a balance of that amount. She also said she would send me all the transcripts of my payment history. A week or so later I received a huge stack of letters not showing a simple account ledger and payment form but pages of insurance codes payments from my insurance company subtractions from my insurance company, subtractions from XXXX XXXX, sporadic listings of my personal payments via their online portal and payments made to the actual XXXX center. As I am not a medical worker or involved in any type of medical coding I could not make any since of what I had received in the mail. I called back to speak with XXXX XXXX and she advised me to call my insurance company and ask a patient advocate. After waiting for my insurance company to get back to me about another month later at this point they told me everything had been paid. I owed a XXXX copayment for using their ambulatory XXXX center instead of using one of my local hospitals affiliated with XXXX XXXX. At this point I called back and spoke with XXXX XXXX and I explained the situation. This is when I was informed that they have two billing systems so some people may had told me my balance was XXXX because their system is not affiliated with their own XXXX centers billing system. She advised me I could make a payment arrangement and I advised her I would call her back within the week as I would need time to figure out where to acquire this unexpected money that I had not budgeted because I had been told numerous times my balance was paid in FULL. Less than a week later I called the billing department to make a payment arrangement and was informed my bill had been sent to collections. I asked if I could still pay them and I was abruptly cut off by a resounding NO. I then asked to speak with XXXX XXXX, head of billing and I was not able to get through. I then called back and left a voicemail with no return. I called and left another voicemail and again no return call. I do not find it fair that I have to pay an excessive amount of money because I was misinformed, not once but many times, by many people, and via their own payment portal. With this being said, when I spoke with XXXX XXXX, I did not dispute the charge. She said she would absolutely allow me to make a payment arrangement. Now I am receiving letters from Choice Recovery , Inc., a collection agency. If arrangements can not be make to have this removed from this credit agency and an arrangement to make payments to XXXX XXXX I will pursue every option I have available including seeking legal advice. {$500.00} may seem a small amount to hire a lawyer over, however if my credit is adversely affected I will use every agency, and legal authority at my disposal. I have already filed a complaint with several agencies, including the XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX your organization is part of, as well as our states Attorney General XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX. If an arrangement can not be made between myself and XXXX  XXXX  for me to make payments on this bill with 100 % excluding this collection agency and no adverse action on my credit report. I will take legal action, and as part of that action it will include damages.",6,"['patient', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'sc', 'sen', 'numerous', 'time', 'xx', 'scheduled', 'xx', 'xx', 'policy', 'al',

Debt collection,"Earlier this year, I rightfully disputed my debt to Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC for {$790.00}, which was purchased from a closed XXXX   XXXX credit card in XX/XX/XXXX. After Portfolio Recovery Associates validated my debt, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to pay off the debt. I explicitly told the representative that I am paying off the debt for full removal from my credit report, and the representative stated that a full deletion would not occur unless paid in full. With the sole purpose of removing the debt from my credit report, I paid the debt of {$790.00} in full on that call. 

However, the paid collection was not removed on my credit report, and still reflected a charge-off on my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a certified letter to Portfolio Recovery Associates to review my call with the representative, and to have my paid collection removed from my credit report. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Portfolio Recovery Associates dated XX/XX/XXXX that they would not conduct an investigation of my dispute and claim of misrepresentation. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to ask again to review my call and request for full deletion. The representative I spoke to referred me to a supervisor and they both explained that full deletions are not offered by Portfolio Recovery Associates. In addition, the supervisor stated that : - a complaint had already been filed on my account ( I never filed a complaint before ) - they will review my call - apologized for any incorrect information that was given to me. 

If I was given full disclosure with the original representative that a deletion was not available, I would have offered a settlement for far less than a payment in full. There is no incentive to a paid-in-full collection that still reports negatively as a charge-off on my credit report. 

Portfolio Recovery Associates is not fully representing the consequences of a paid collection to those looking to pay their debts in full. I did not deny the debt and take responsibility for it with full payment, however, I would have made a different decision to pay a settlement, not paid in full.",6,"['earlier', 'year', 'rightfuly', 'disputed', 'debt', 'portfolio', 'recovery', 'asociates', 'lc', 'purchased', 'closed', 'xx', 'xx', 'credit', 'card', 'xxxx', 'portfolio', 'recovery', 'asociates', 'validated', 'debt', 'caled', 'xxxx', 'pay', 'debt', 'explicitly', 'told', 'representative', 'paying', 'debt', 'ful', 'removal', 'credit', 'report', 'representative', 'stated', 'ful', 'deletion', 'would', 'ocur', 'unles', 'paid', 'ful', 'sole', 'purpose', 'removing', 'debt', 'credit', 'report', 'paid', 'debt', 'ful', 'cal', 'however', 'paid', 'colection', 'removed', 'credit', 'report', 'stil', 'reflected', 'chargeof', 'credit', 'report', 'xxxx', 'sent', 'certified', 'leter', 'portfolio', 'recovery', 'asociates', 'review', 'cal', 'representative', 'paid', 'colection', 'removed', 'credit', 'report', 'xxxx', 'received', 'leter', 'portfolio', 'recovery', 'asociates', 'dated', 'xxxx', 'would', 'conduct', 'investigation', 'dispute', 'claim', 'misrepresentation', 'caled', 'xxxx', 'ask', 'review', 'cal', 'request', 'ful', 'deletion', 'representative', 'spoke', 'refered', 'supervisor', 'explained', 'ful', 'deletion', 'ofered', 'portfolio', 'recovery', 'asociates', 'adition', 'supervisor', 'stated', 'complaint', 'already', 'ben', 'filed', 'acount', 'never', 'filed', 'complaint', 'wil', 'review', 'cal', 'apologized', 'incorect', 'information', 'given', 'given', 'ful', 'disclosure', 'original', 'representative', 'deletion', 'available', 'would', 'ofered', 'setlement', 'far', 'le', 'payment', 'ful', 'incentive', 'paidinful', 'colection', 'stil', 'report', 'negatively', 'chargeof', 'credit', 'report', 'portfolio', 'recovery', 'asociates', 'fuly', 'representing', 'consequence', 'paid', 'colection', 'loking', 'pay', 'debt', 'ful', 'deny', 'debt', 'take', 'responsibility', 'ful', 'payment', 'however', 'would', 'made', 'diferent', 'decision', 'pay', 'setlement', 'paid', 'ful']",earlier year rightfuly disputed debt portfolio recovery asociates lc purchased closed xx xx credit card xxxx portfolio recovery asociates validated debt caled xxxx pay debt explicitly told representative paying debt ful removal credit report representative stated ful deletion would ocur unles paid ful sole purpose removing debt credit report paid debt ful cal however paid colection removed credit report stil reflected chargeof credit report xxxx sent certified leter portfolio recovery asociates review cal representative paid colection removed credit report xxxx received leter portfolio recovery asociates dated xxxx would conduct investigation dispute claim misrepresentation caled xxxx ask review cal request ful deletion representative spoke refered supervisor explained ful deletion ofered portfolio recovery asociates adition supervisor stated complaint already ben filed acount never filed complaint wil review cal apologized incorect information given given ful disclosure original representative deletion available would ofered setlement far le payment ful incentive paidinful colection stil report negatively chargeof credit report portfolio recovery asociates fuly representing consequence paid colection loking pay debt ful deny debt take responsibility ful payment however would made diferent decision pay setlement paid ful

( hereafter SPS Inc. ), XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX f/k/a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereafter XXXX ), where each of them, ( collectively Respondents ' ) are threatening to seize, attach, and sale our property in a unlawful non-judicial foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX although Respondents ' holds "" NO SECURED INTEREST '' in our property for the following REASONS : ( a ), The Transaction is rescinded effective by operation of law on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX nor its agents or representative filed a legal response within 20 days after service. thus, the note, deed and contract is void as a matter of law, see EX-D2 ; and ( b ) prior to the rescission, the Transaction was already a nullity from its INCEPTION in that the deed and other documents were SIGNED by an unauthorized agent for its principal, in violation of Georgia law which says, "" Where an agent without authority to execute a sealed instrument signs a contract under seal for his principal, the later is not bound unless ratification thereof be also under seal. XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' See unauthorized signer at EX-S1 ; and ( c ) A permanent sale was made and not recorded, the ASSET was transferred out of the alleged TRUSS to XXXX XXXX XXXX on or before XX/XX/XXXX. See EX-D7. <P/>2. We also have evidence and good cause to believe that SPS Inc., & XXXX filed the present foreclosure action under a MODIFIED fictitious name instead of using it 's legal registered fictitious name as required by the State of NY Article 3 - 301 and state of GA Real estate Comm. Ch. 40 ( a ) and ( c ) ( 2 ). <P/>3. The foreclosure Sale Under Power notice IS NOT BROUGHT by the party identified in the security deed neither is it brought by the party listed on the first and only DEED ASSIGNMENT as required by Georgia Real estate Comm. Ch. 40 ( a ), and ( c ) ( 2 ) which says : "" The only person or financial institution allowed to sell the property of a borrower in default is the party identified in the security deed as the lender '' or "" If the original lender sold the security deed, the power of sale rights transfers to this "" successor. "" It also says : "" The published notice must contain the name of the Lender '' 4. XXXX, SPS Inc., and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, used Concealment and misrepresentation of a material fact, to disguise its true "" descriptive '' fictitious name. <P/>5. Under Chapter 40 ( a ) and ( c ) ( 2 ), XXXX and SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX always use the following legal fictitious name for non-judicial foreclosures actions, see EX D-2A, which is a XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Notice of Sale Under Power publication, where the following legal name is asserted as true under the statutory requirement of Georgia. <P/>( d ) '' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX f/k/a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, As Trustee For The Certificateholders XXXX, XXXX, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series XXXX. <P/>6. In the NEW Sale Under Power Notice, Respondents ' abandoned a key "" descriptive '' term in its registered fictitious name they are require to use by the PSA. Note that Respondent, in the paragraph below, did not use the descriptive portion of its registered fictitious name that identifies XXXX as the trustee "" For the Certificateholders ''. -- - Instead, Respondent used the following fictitious name omitting and disguising its legal fictitious name per the PSA requirement. See EX-S3, then see 6 ( e ) below, ( the MODIFIED fictitious name. <P/>( e ) "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX f/k/a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, As Trustee For XXXX, XXXX, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series XXXX ''. <P/>7. The Respondents ' can not truthfully assert that it is the "" Trustee for the certificateholder '' without misrepresenting a material fact. So XXXX avoided using its legal registered descriptive name when filing a action against us in Court which has now been dismissed. See EX-D4 pg.2,3. <P/>8. See EX- ( D-5 ) which shows unsolicited documents sent to us by Respondents ' purported servicer, SPS Inc. which shows Respondent 's laying the foundation for the insertion of a modified or alternant version of the Truss legal fictitious name to be relied upon by us, the Court and CFPB as true and correct.

Student loan,"To whom it may concern : Nelnet is harassing me and using false information to collect on my student loans. I have been on the Total and permanent XXXX program since XX/XX/XXXX and was supposed to be done with the 3 year monitoring program as of XX/XX/XXXX. I did everything I was supposed to do to be qualified for the program. And for the first two years everything went smoothly. However, two months after I was supposed to be off of the program I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX telling me that my loans of {$71000.00} were being reinstated because my employment earning exceeded the {$16000.00} limit for the time between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This is false and they have been harassing me and threatening my credit history, earning wages and that the loans would be reinstated as of XX/XX/XXXX. I asked them several times how much I supposedly went over and they refused to give me answer except for sending me an equation on how they came to the determination that I was over the limit. They also, told me they were determining the amount on future wages I had not errand yet. Which by law they can not use future erranings that I have not made against me. For the whole year of XX/XX/XXXX I made a total on my XXXX of {$11000.00} and if you divide that by half it is only {$5900.00} because they are only using the XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to the end of XX/XX/XXXX. And if you take my wages errand from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX I errand {$9900.00}. This gives you a grand total of {$15000.00} and the last time I checked this is under the {$16000.00}. 

When I contacted Nelnet their answer was that I could apply again for the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX program and be monitored for another 3 years! I told them that I 've done what they asked and that my loans should have been discharged and forgiven and that I did not have to reapply for that reason. They refused and refused to give me any information on how to appeal the decision or the amount I supposedly made that put me over. 

So, my first payment of {$550.00} is due on XX/XX/XXXX and the bill I received stated that I owed {$45000.00}. However, I signed into Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX and it states that I owe a total of {$71000.00} and that my first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX is {$830.00}. The amount continues to change and the payment amount continues to change. How do they expect someone who is on SSI XXXX and works part-time to pay {$830.00} a month? That is almost all the money I make in the month. I am barely feeding myself and keeping gas in my car but, yet they feel I 'm making more than enough to pay back almost {$900.00} a month. I have no means or way to pay them back and I have a letter from my XXXX doctor stating that I will never be able to function normally to the point that I can hold permanent full-time work. Also, SSI has stated that in the last review of my case that nothing has changed with my status of XXXX and that it was not going to change in the future due to my XXXX. Nelnet is placing an undue hardship on me. 

I am currently seeking the advice of a Student loan lawyer in this matter due to the undue hardship they are putting on me. I was told that I should contact the CFPB in this matter first however, if they continue to refuse to not discharge my loans. And continue to harass me, destroy my credit or try to go after my wages then I have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and ask for a special Adversary hearing with a Judge. 

Nelnet XXXX program cares nothing for the people they monitor and they look for any reason to reinstate you.",8,"['may', 'concern', 'nelnet', 'harasing', 'using', 'false', 'information', 'colect', 'student', 'loan', 'ben', 'total', 'permanent', 'xx', 'program', 'since', 'xxxx', 'suposed', 'done', 'year', 'monitoring', 'program', 'xxxx', 'everything', 'suposed', 'qualified', 'program', 'first', 'two', 'year', 'everything', 'went', 'smothly', 'however', 'two', 'month', 'suposed', 'program', 'received', 'leter', 'xxxx', 'teling', 'loan', 'reinstated', 'employment', 'earning', 'exceded', 'limit', 'time', 'betwen', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'false', 'ben', 'harasing', 'threatening', 'credit', 'history', 'earning', 'wage', 'loan', 'would', 'reinstated', 'xxxx', 'asked', 'several', 'time', 'much', 'suposedly', 'went', 'refused', 'give', 'answer', 'except', 'sending', 'equation', 'came', 'determination', 'limit', 'also', 'told', 'determing', 'amount', 'future', 'wage', 'erand', 'yet', 'law', 'use', 'future', 'eranings', 'made', 'whole', 'year', 'xxxx', 'made', 'total', 'xx', 'divide', 'half', 'using', 'xx', 'xxxx', 'end', 'xxxx', 'take', 'wage', 'erand', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'erand', 'give', 'grand', 'total', 'last', 'time', 'checked', 'contacted', 'nelnet', 'answer', 'could', 'aply', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'program', 'monitored', 'another', 'year', 'told', 'done', 'asked', 'loan', 'ben', 'discharged', 'forgiven', 'reaply', 'reason', 'refused', 'refused', 'give', 'information', 'apeal', 'decision', 'amount', 'suposedly', 'made', 'put', 'first', 'payment', 'due', 'xxxx', 'bil', 'received', 'stated', 'owed', 'however', 'signed', 'nelnet', 'xxxx', 'state', 'owe', 'total', 'first', 'payment', 'due', 'xxxx', 'amount', 'continues', 'change', 'payment', 'amount', 'continues', 'change', 'expect', 'someone', 'si', 'xx', 'work', 'partime', 'pay', 'month', 'almost', 'al', 'money', 'make', 'month', 'barely', 'feding', 'keping', 'gas', 'car', 'yet', 'fel', 'making', 'enough', 'pay', 'back', 'almost', 'month', 'mean', 'way', 'pay', 'back', 'leter', 'xx', 'doctor', 'stating', 'wil', 'never', 'able', 'function', 'normaly', 'point', 'hold', 'permanent', 'fultime', 'work', 'also', 'si', 'stated', 'last', 'review', 'case', 'nothing', 'changed', 'status', 'xx', 'going', 'change', 'future', 'due', 'xx', 'nelnet', 'placing', 'undue', 'hardship', 'curently', 'seking', 'advice', 'student', 'loan', 'lawyer', 'mater', 'due', 'undue', 'hardship', 'puting', 'told', 'contact', 'cfpb', 'mater', 'first', 'however', 'continue', 'refuse', 'discharge', 'loan', 'continue', 'haras', 'destroy', 'credit', 'try', 'go', 'wage', 'choice', 'declare', 'bankruptcy', 'ask', 'special', 'adversary', 'hearing', 'judge', 'nelnet', 'xx', 'program', 'care', 'nothing', 'people', 'monitor', 'lok', 'reason', 'reinstate']",may concern nelnet harasing using false information colect student loan ben total permanent xx program since xxxx suposed done year monitoring program xxxx everything suposed qualified program first two year everything went smothly however two month suposed program received leter xxxx teling loan reinstated employment earning exceded limit time betwen xxxx xxxx false ben harasing threatening credit history earning wage loan would reinstated xxxx asked several time much suposedly went refused give answer except sending equation came determination limit also told determing amount future wage erand yet law use future eranings made whole year xxxx made total xx divide half using xx xxxx end xxxx take wage erand xxxx xxxx erand give grand total last time checked contacted nelnet answer could aply xx xx xx xx program monitored another year told done asked loan ben discharged forgiven reaply reason refused refused give information apeal decision amount suposedly made put first payment due xxxx bil received stated owed however signed nelnet xxxx state owe total first payment due xxxx amount continues change payment amount continues change expect someone si xx work partime pay month almost al money make month barely feding keping gas car yet fel making enough pay back almost month mean way pay back leter xx doctor stating wil never able function normaly point hold permanent fultime work also si stated last review case nothing changed status xx going change future due xx nelnet placing undue hardship curently seking advice student loan lawyer mater due undue hardship puting told contact cfpb mater first however continue refuse discharge loan continue haras destroy credit try go wage choice declare bankruptcy ask special adversary hearing judge nelnet xx program care nothing people monitor lok reason reinstate
Mortgage,"I was inquiring about a loan modification. I called the bank and was told that wasn't a option. I then started the short sale process but seem to get the run around with the company that was servicing the mortgage for XXXX XXXX XXXX. So the house went into foreclosure and the bank never served me court papers for said court date. I only was made aware of this process while doing a court search myself. I was going through the paperwork filed to the courts and realized that XXXX XXXX XXXX filed fraudulent paperwork to obtain this foreclosure in the first place. I filed a motion to ask the court to look at this matter but they couldn't do anything to help. 

I have attached a copy of the filing that I submitted and page 6 through 10 are the paperwork that XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted to obtain the foreclosure in the first place. If you look that the motion you can see where they cut and pasted parts of the contract to help them obtain the foreclosure.

Mortgage,"I owned a home in the XXXX area. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not doing a great job at all. I encourage you to read all the complaints of Bank of America from consumers. I honestly had the hardest time with the banks, and the banks are whining? I was never reimbursed for a check fraud complaint with the XXXX with BAC. I had lost my job, my car and wanted to short-sale my home. The XXXX answer was there is nothing we can do about it. 
I wanted to short-sale my home sooner but the Management Company of my condo refused to provide the realtor with the keys. I filed a motion to stay the sale. The Bank never called me. I filed several documents that were requested as a home modification. I am working part-time and I filed all my hardship documents. 
My realtors attorney filed the correct paperwork, and the bank lied and said that the documents were not there according to XXXX XXXX at Bank of America when XXXX XXXX stated all I needed was a copy of my license and this was all I needed. In fact, I know the bank lied because an employee of the bank requested that a XXXX form re-completed by XXXX XXXX, which was in part of the attorneys documents. The foreclosure attorney XXXX XXXX who works at XXXX XXXX , XXXX in XXXX would not return my calls, because as a consequence my short sale never happened ( the bank refused ), and put me through XXXX. My condo was placed on the Market for one day and returned to the bank. I wanted answers from the foreclosure attorney XXXX XXXX as to what happened to my property ( only on the market for a day? ), and I get no response when my home was put on the market for one day then taken off the market. I hear on the news that the banks feel that the XXXX is over aggressive. I have a part-time job and underemployed. I was put into foreclosure due to fraud of the Management Company and the Board members. I was forced out of my home with the hopes of getting my relocation expenses reimbursed, and to prevent huge damage to my credit which never happened. 
I filed against the bank a long time ago a complaint with the Federal Reserve, and all I get from BAC is a voice mail from the regulations Department from XXXX XXXX. I always had to call the bank with no return calls. I even escalated this issue to Management XXXX XXXX and she did nothing prior to the Bank making me go through all kinds of steps prior to a short-sale, which was denied. Bank of America lacks transparency and is not honest with consumers by dragging out the time and costs of a consumer trying to short sale a home. More importantly, May be engaged in illegal activity by non-actions. I strongly urge an investigation.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hello, I was deceptively charged for a recurring service that I never signed up for, or was not made aware that I signed up for. 

I received ZERO communication via email, regular mail, or via phone from Experian that I had a recurring service from them and was being charged to my XXXX XXXX credit card. 

I had no access to the service either, as again, I never received ANY communication from them, so I never received a username and password or any instructions on how to access the recurring service. I, to this day, have not used the service they signed me up for, and since it 's just a website with a credit report on it, never received anything from them, nor did they incur any costs since nothing was ever delivered. 

I did, on a one time basis, access my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX, after the XXXX hack. That charge was for {$4.00}. I assume that they signed me up for the recurring service then, and deceptively did not CLEARLY state I was signing up for a service. 

I discovered the issue last year in XX/XX/XXXX when I reviewed my XXXX XXXX credit card statements and realized the recurring charges. I initially attempted to contact Experian, but could not reach them after being on hold over the phone for over an hour. So I then sent a dispute to XXXX XXXX XXXX. After several weeks ( was traveling to see family over XXXX ) with no response from XXXX XXXX, I contacted them again to dispute the charges. Yesterday, I finally received several emails from XXXX XXXX indicating that the charges would be rebilled to my account. 

I then contacted Experian again this morning by calling XXXX and was on hold for over 1 hour and 30 minutes ( I have a screenshot to prove it ) and was finally able to get a customer service agent on the phone. 

The customer service agent I spoke with is named 'XXXX ' on team 'XXXX ' within the customer service center. This agent said that they could not remove the charges. I then spoke with his manager 'XXXX ' (  agent # XXXX ) and she would not remove the charges either. 

The charges total {$170.00}. The charges occurred from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Please see the attached screenshot of the charges from my online XXXX XXXX account.",1,"['helo', 'deceptively', 'charged', 'recuring', 'service', 'never', 'signed', 'made', 'aware', 'signed', 'received', 'zero', 'comunication', 'via', 'email', 'regular', 'mail', 'via', 'phone', 'experian', 'recuring', 'service', 'charged', 'xx', 'xx', 'credit', 'card', 'ace', 'service', 'either', 'never', 'received', 'comunication', 'never', 'received', 'username', 'pasword', 'instruction', 'ace', 'recuring', 'service', 'day', 'used', 'service', 'signed', 'since', 'website', 'credit', 'report', 'never', 'received', 'anything', 'incur', 'cost', 'since', 'nothing', 'ever', 'delivered', 'one', 'time', 'basis', 'ace', 'credit', 'report', 'xxxx', 'xx', 'hack', 'charge', 'asume', 'signed', 'recuring', 'service', 'deceptively', 'clearly', 'state', 'signing', 'service', 'discovered', 'isue', 'last', 'year', 'xxxx', 'reviewed', 'xx', 'xx', 'credit', 'card', 'statement', 'realized', 'recuring', 'charge', 'initialy', 'atempted', 'contact', 'experian', 'could', 'reach', 'hold', 'phone', 'hour', 'sent', 'dispute', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'several', 'weks', 'traveling', 'se', 'family', 'xx', 'response', 'xx', 'xx', 'contacted', 'dispute', 'charge', 'yesterday', 'finaly', 'received', 'several', 'email', 'xx', 'xx', 'indicating', 'charge', 'would', 'rebiled', 'acount', 'contacted', 'experian', 'morning', 'caling', 'xx', 'hold', 'hour', 'minute', 'screnshot', 'prove', 'finaly', 'able', 'get', 'customer', 'service', 'agent', 'phone', 'customer', 'service', 'agent', 'spoke', 'named', 'xx', 'team', 'xx', 'within', 'customer', 'service', 'center', 'agent', 'said', 'could', 'remove', 'charge', 'spoke', 'manager', 'xx', 'agent', 'xx', 'would', 'remove', 'charge', 'either', 'charge', 'total', 'charge', 'ocured', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'please', 'se', 'atached', 'screnshot', 'charge', 'online', 'xx', 'xx', 'acount']",helo deceptively charged recuring service never signed made aware signed received zero comunication via email regular mail via phone experian recuring service charged xx xx credit card ace service either never received comunication never received username pasword instruction ace recuring service day used service signed since website credit report never received anything incur cost since nothing ever delivered one time basis ace credit report xxxx xx hack charge asume signed recuring service deceptively clearly state signing service discovered isue last year xxxx reviewed xx xx credit card statement realized recuring charge initialy atempted contact experian could reach hold phone hour sent dispute xx xx xx several weks traveling se family xx response xx xx contacted dispute charge yesterday finaly received several email xx xx indicating charge would rebiled acount contacted experian morning caling xx hold hour minute screnshot prove finaly able get customer service agent phone customer service agent spoke named xx team xx within customer service center agent said could remove charge spoke manager xx agent xx would remove charge either charge total charge ocured xxxx xxxx please se atached screnshot charge online xx xx acount

Credit card or prepaid card,"US Supreme Court versus American Express [ et.al ] XX/XX/XXXX : "" 6 % might be anti-trusting but 100 % is definitely not trustworthy ... '' At the onset of the scheduled court hearing ( case ), I was attacked at my home business ; the home invasion felony false pretense forced entry -- two Auto Lock Locksmith 's w/a gang of about ten others started removing the front door locks on my home business building : not on my XXXX XXXX XXXX that's still locked inside my garage being stolen -- armed robbery grand theft larceny assault has NOT ended. I was forced to rent a motel room for my safety and living necessity : I rented XXXX # XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX AZ XXXX. The property management said : yes, but we don't get paid the money ; there was no one who could really ask for payment. 

AmEx billed me slightly over {$3600.00} ( three thousand, six hundred ) and after the XXXX XXXX XXXX owner/manager merchant could not respond to dispute : AmEx refunded {$600.00}. AmEx -- not any rightful owed merchant : the room was legally not rentable in accordance to AZ state laws -- stole {$3000.00} from me by demanding I pay a motel bill that only AmEx employees were charging. XXXX XXXX XXXX did not have a valid merchant bank account : AmEx knew it. I only got the {$600.00} back after the very same man who held me at gunpoint at my home business ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) arrived at the motel to order me out of XXXX # XXXX, despite my already having paid AmEx for it ( in advance by a week : my week quite up yet ). 

I relocated across the street to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX AZ XXXX where I was constantly told my money payment -- what I was paying to AmEx for 'XXXX XXXX XXXX ' XXXX # XXXX rent -- wasn't as good as no payment at all or certainly not as good as invalidated bogus bank ( XXXX money ) card payments. I finally was forced to relocate to a back room that is not rentable for money payment either ( in accordance to AZ state law ). AmEx has billed me {$4800.00} for XXXX # XXXX at the XXXX XXXX : but "" XXXX '' has not been paid any of it. XXXX XXXX does not have a valid merchant bank account for AmEx to pay with my money. BUT I'VE HAD TO PAY MY AMEX BILL -- or lose my card priviledges -- AND MY PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN DEBITED ( subtracted ) OUT OF MY AMEX SAVINGS ACCOUNT available balance : it's just not been paid anyone. The only entity billing me for charges on my AmEx card is AmEx : over {$16000.00} worth since XXXX XXXX! And that's how much has been debited ( subtracted ) from my AmEx savings account available -- for my needs -- balance. AmEx is NOT paying any of the merchants for the charges on my card : they do not have valid merchant bank accounts to get paid. AmEx employees think they can force me into death or irreparable homelessness and unemployment dispair by stealing all my money and by not really stealing : it's all still inside my AmEx savings account or it's only debited ( subtracted ) on the bank account statements AmEx presents to me. For my practical purpose : over {$16000.00} has been stolen and even if only by relocation in my account to "" unavailable balance '' ... 

When XXXX and then XXXX immediately thereafter ( by order of US Fed Reserve Bank-US Treasury ) closed XX/XX/XXXX, all the merchants -- XXXX, USPS, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and more : it was like a distortion of communism that evolved from the mass FDIC bank failure crisis XXXX -- lost their merchant account pay ( bank ) arrangement.

Since that time, AmEx has demanded I pay only AmEx for my purchase charges because NO ONE ELSE IS REALLY CHARGING ME AND THE REASON IS THEY CAN NOT GET PAID : THEY DON'T HAVE VALID MERCHANT ACCOUNTS AT BANKS TO PAY. The merchants all say they aren't really charging me but AmEx is charging and debiting my AmEx savings account balance. If I don't get the money reinstated to my AmEx savings account "" available '' balance, no one will ever get the use the money. Why AmEx does it : to dangle the theft amount like a golden carrot to enable stealing money from even more victims and specifically, from other AmEx employees. 

The point to it -- however -- is moot : AmEx employees and all that's left of the public majority have less than -XXXX- money and no money access. It's indefinite : they will never have/earn or own any money of their own and they do not care -- they are all in invalidated bogus bank card use heaven right now : while supplies last -- because they all psychotically thought the only income they were being paid was money being stolen from murdered victims. That NEVER HAPPENED : they were not being allowed to steal any money from other persons ( dead or alive ) but that brain damaged understanding is why they were more than happy to get only XXXX "" spend '' for ever $ XXXX "" negative balance credit debit '' on what was their XXXX/XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) pay/debit cards. All the bogus bank pay/debit cards were invalidated, XXXX XXXX ; it's over. It will never happen again. 

I have not -- despite legitimate efforts to regain safe passage/access to my property by court order -- been able to be at my home business because they all think they can murder me to use my money and property to support themselves instead ... Who are they?! Nearly every other person including American Express employees as a leader of their pack : almost the entire population is now just XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ; not one productive affluent -- educated, healthy, income earning, fine business reputation, property owner, tax payer -- person can live anywhere at the US without suffering chronic assault. They think robbing a person to death is the only way they've ever earned support.",3,"['u', 'supreme', 'court', 'versus', 'american', 'expres', 'etal', 'xxxx', 'might', 'antitrusting', 'definitely',

Mortgage,"On XXXX, I requested a loan payoff from Seterus Inc, through their website, which states it will go in my secure inbox within 3 days.

XXXX informed me that was a mistake and it takes 7-10 business days. She was rude as well, so I complained to the FDIC and called back because think about this, how much money does Seterus make by putting off giving those payoffs in a timely manner based on people 's daily rates? Mutliply all the other customers they do that to. They told my lender they get XXXX requestsa month. That is a lot of sonsuer money. I got XXXX the next time, who lied and said I did n't request the buyout until Monday the XXXX, but she would see that I should get it by Friday morning. I still had nothing, so I spoke with XXXX who saw my original request and she would see if she could expedite it at another 1-3 business days. I got the request later that afternoon.

Mortgage,5/3 Bank severely mismanaged my escrow account causing a deficient of {$3700.00}. They bought out my mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. They mismanaged the property taxes for my property for XX/XX/XXXX. They said they thought my property taxes were {$330.00} when in turn they were paid the previous year as {$2400.00}. My prior mortgage company paid the appropriate taxes the year before but they said they had no idea what the correct amount was for. How could this be? I have had numerous mortgage companies buy out my mortgage for 15 years and have never had this issue before. They also did not even pay my mortgage insurance when it was due in XX/XX/XXXX.

Checking or savings account,"In XX/XX/XXXX, my checking account was placed on restriction due to fraudulent check deposits on my Navy Federal Credit Union checking account. They were in the amount totaling over {$2000.00}. I had no knowledge of these deposits until I was unable to log onto my NFCU account via the XXXX app. When I found out about this issue, I immediately called NFCU about the matter and they went ahead and open up a Fraud claim. Two weeks later, I got a letter in the mail stating that the claim was denied & I owed the negative balance on my account. I have been fighting this matter for seven months and each time I would speak to a Security rep, they would tell me that they are looking into the matter and will get back to me. That never happened, as I had to always make the first move. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to another Security rep, as I was in the process of starting a new fraud claim to retrieve my checking account back. The rep told me that I didn't need to start another claim and the only way that I can get an appeal is if I pay the negative balance on my account. I should not be liable for paying back this balance, as I did commit the illegal actions. It is a major inconvenience, as I haven't been able to use any services that Navy Federal offers ever since last year & I had to pay off and close out my credit card that I had with them.

Mortgage,"Back in XX/XX/2018, BEFORE I got behind on my payments, I contacted Mr. Cooper, my mortgage lender, and informed them that I was being placed on bedrest due to XXXX complications. I requested any assistance that they could provide to help me with my mortgage while I was on bedrest to keep from falling behind. They told me that all I could do was apply for a loan modification. I applied and the modification was finally denied in XXXX of 2018. I was informed that the reason for the denial was lack of income. The agent who informed me that my only option was a modification was well aware that I had no income due to my health status. I went back to work in XXXX, but now my mortgage is about 4 months behind, and Ive made my usual payment since then. All of my savings was used up while I was off work for almost 7 months. After returning to work, I was encouraged to reapply for the loan modification in hopes of saving my house. It was also denied on XX/XX/2018, because my obligations exceed my income. Isnt that why I need the modification? I called on that day and spoke to a representative ( who told me why my modification was denied ) and asked who I could file a complaint with against their company and was told that my loan was an FHA loan so the FHA is my lender, and they dont take phone calls. The FHA doesnt lend money - they guarantee loans, AND I have a conventional loan. Mr Cooper has lied to me over and over.

On  XXXX / XXXX /   2017  I made  one last call to them and spoke about what happened and was trying to get it corrected. I was told I would be fine to try again and that the two failed attempts would not post and would fall off. This was clearly a lie and one posted and caused me to go into the negatives. I called to get this fixed and was patronized and treated poorly. I have had to call back several times to get this fixed and still nothing. Now I 'm in the negatives all because of a lie that was told to me with absolutely no urgency to fix it.,4,"['trying', 'make', 'rent', 'payment', 'landlord', 'amount', 'payment', 'came', 'went', 'back', 'twice', 'xx', 'xx', 'made', 'one', 'last', 'cal', 'spoke', 'hapened', 'trying', 'get', 'corected', 'told', 'would', 'fine', 'try', 'two', 'failed', 'atempts', 'would', 'post', 'would', 'fal', 'clearly', 'lie', 'one', 'posted', 'caused', 'go', 'negative', 'caled', 'get', 'fixed', 'patronized', 'treated', 'porly', 'cal', 'back', 'several', 'time', 'get', 'fixed', 'stil', 'nothing', 'negative', 'al', 'lie', 'told', 'absolutely', 'urgency', 'fix']",trying make rent payment landlord amount payment came went back twice xx xx made one last cal spoke hapened trying get corected told would fine try two failed atempts would post would fal clearly lie one posted caused go negative caled get fixed patronized treated porly cal back several time get fixed stil nothing negative al lie told absolutely urgency fix
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Transunion continues to ignore my disputes and not fix the problem. I have repeatedly disputed some of the items over and over and over again. To no avail, even with proof the account is inaccurate, they simply send an Email stating the investigation is complete, when they are not investigating accurately AT ALL. Specifically : On XX/XX/2019 : I disputed : XXXX XXXX, # XXXX and it states it is accurate when in fact it is not. This is a sold debt that was in fact closed on with XXXX with no monies being owed to that party, as I was not in a contract with them. Further, this account is being reported as if its a new debt and in fact it is not. Lastly, I have RECEIVED NO communication from XXXX XXXX about this debt- AT ALL. 

On XX/XX/2019 : I disputed : XXXX XXXX, # XXXX. This car was totaled in an accident and the car was paid off by my insurance agency, XXXX XXXX and there was NEVER a late payment. In fact, the car was paid off 7 days after the accident. I DO NOT CARE what XXXX XXXX   tells you it is proof of this with the XXXX PD and of course XXXX   XXXX. It remains inaccurate on my report and you have NOT done due diligence according to FDCPA. 

On XX/XX/2019 : For the 5th time- I disputed : XXXX  XXXX # XXXX. I still have my XXXX XXXX account open and this {$77.00} is incorrect. 

On XX/XX/2019 : I disputed : XXXX XXXX # XXXX There was NEVER a late payment with this account. I received a 2 month forbearance due to dealer tag and title paperwork to tag the car was not sent to me in a proper timeframe upon purchase of the vehicle ( of no fault of my own ) XXXX is aware and I have documentation of proof to show ; Payments have just resumed. 

Lastly : on XX/XX/2019 : I disputed : XXXX XXXX  # XXXX : I have no knowledge of this company, I have not received any debt collection information from this company and further the debt in question is not mine! How is it this information can just appear on my report without any knowledge to me of the who, what, when, where or why?

Included in the wire transfer 's "" recipient special instructions '' was the special code exactly as stated in Coinbase 's instructions to allow it to be credited to my Coinbase account. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the funds have never been credited to my Coinbase account, nor returned to my financial institution through any method ( wire, ACH, etc. ) -- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- - Called Coinbase multiple times, only to be told that they can't resolve any issues like this on the phone. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- -Opened a case in Coinbase 's issue system about a missing wire transfer. No response. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- -Sent another message to Coinbase regarding the missing wire transfer. No response. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- - Sent fifty-two ( 52 ) more messages to Coinbase regarding the missing wire transfer. All of these messages show up in their case management system online. Still no response. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- -Received message claiming high support volumes, and how my {$11000.00} issue was of low priority to them. Apparently, according to this message, forgotten passwords were of highest priority, and are more important than {$11000.00} in cash gone missing for nearly a month. Also, the next highest priority tier of things included "" limit increase requests, '' which I had requested and since then already received. On that same list were "" referral bonus inquiries '' and "" general questions '', which means that they're treating my {$11000.00} problem as lower priority than all of these.

-- -- - [ [ [ Early XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- -Called XXXX XXXX XXXX and confirmed that Coinbase received my wire transfer on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it was credited to their bank account that same day. Was told to talk to my financial institution and ask them to send a message to Coinbase through the bank wire messaging system.

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- -At my request, my financial institution sent a message over federal wire to Coinbase asking for the funds to be returned in full. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] -- -- -Called my financial institution to follow up on request. Still no response. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] ] -- -- -Filed a complaint by email with Coinbase 's bank 's compliance department ( XXXX ) informing them of the details of this long-standing problem. No response since. 

-- -- - [ [ [ XX/XX/XXXX ] ] ] ] -- -- - Called Coinbase 's bank and asked the status of the return. They told me they had sent the message on to Coinbase but had not received a response from them at all. Called my financial institution and asked them to send a message to Coinbase through the federal wire system every dayuntil they get a response. I informed their bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that these messages would be coming, and they agreed to forward every message on to Coinbase.

XXXX customer service and XXXX XXXX XXXX need to work together to fix my account. Bank has permission to show cus ser copy 's of billing statements, to review flex payments corrections. 
2. The order created on XX/XX/XXXXis NOT to be added to the final credit card bill. I am seeking to know what I owe on my bill, from start of acct through XX/XX/XXXX. ONLY. 

3. Please fully review and address credit card history from the start of the card throughXX/XX/XXXX. 
*First, Please remove of all postal charges to all items added on my account, as I have only ordered items with the Advertised return shipping labels. I have met all requested steps to comply with returning items as needed with the appropriate labels. 
4. Next, please review my XXXX history and XXXX posted amounts on all of my purchased items, to ensure that I was billed correctly with the appropriate price on the items/w taxes, that I currently have now. ***This step is not negotiable as my last billing statement alone had multiple billing payment errors on it. This would also be easy see and correct with computer software. 

5. Please view and address all over payments ... ..with the interest charges on my credit card account for each month and CREDIT my account back accordingly. 

Ideally, I would like to have one rep. contact from XXXX XXXX XXXX and one from XXXX customer service via an email. This would help if someone had questions or if I had questions for them. I will be reviewing my statements for errors as well but I will need to know that I can contact somebody, if I find additional errors, to ensure that they see the same thing that I'm seeing. 

I am very disappointed in XXXX customer service and XXXX XXXX XXXX with the handling of my account to date. I am stressed and frustrated and I want these basic issues addressed on my account ASAP. I just want to get account paid off and get XXXX and bank out of my life. 
Be very clear, I will not be sending another payment on card until I am 100 % sure of what I am paying for and what I am paying on. 
I am done with both XXXX customer service and XXXX  XXXX telling me to call one another in order to fix my problems and I'm tired of being ignored. 
***BOTH complanys have worked to create this mess and they both need to work together to fix errors. 


As of XX/XX/XXXX : Both companys REFUSE to fix my acct or talk with me, acct continues to spiral out of control with interest and both company are continuously harassing me thru : calling me, texting me and email me to pay my bill. 
The first major problem I had is XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card XXXX XXXX XXXX  would not identify if they were the same agency or two separate agencies in this process. Neither agency would clearly identify what their role in the billing process was, so I found myself very confused throughout this process in trying to get my issues address. Neither agency took the dispute of my balance seriously. Both agencies has allowed my disputed balance from XX/XX/XXXX to "" snowball '' into added interest and in XX/XX/XXXX have started massively harassing me to pay my bills : by text messages, emails and numerous automated calls to my phone. I find this harassive and stressful. 
I have contacted the Better Business Bureau in Florida and Ohio on both agencies and there was no response from the companies to resolve the issues on my acct. I have gone on to report issue to the Federal Trade Commission and to the Consumer Finance public Bureau for resolution. To date both companies REFUSE to help resolve my acct issues. 

**Consumers need to be aware of how their XXXX credit card is being mannipulated and fraudulently being handled. With what I have been finding out of over time, XXXX and bank, owes me money. 
1. I have been randomly charged postal fees for return items even though I have used the free return labels as instructed by XXXX. 
2. I have returned unwanted items back to XXXX in a very timely manner however those returns have been held until the next billing cycle. This has caused 26 % interest charges in items that i did have and that I found out, that the company held. I see this as fraudulent. 
3. I have been sending over- payments monthly to my credit card, to pay off items that I wanted to buy. What I found out however is that the items that were on XXXX XXXX XXXX, is locked in for those months, selected, with no exceptions. I see this is fraudulent. 
* '' * Consumers are not aware of this as this clearly does not give the consumer the sales or special prices on items that they purchased. * '' *Faliure to inform consumer ... ... 
4. I have also asked XXXX customer service where my extra money has been gone and they WILL NOT TELL ME where my over payments have gone, over the time of my account history. 3yrs I see this as fraudulent. 
5. neither agency appear to want to help me with my ongoing account concerns. Each agency tells me to call the other. 
6. I found out in this process that the bank in XX/XX/XXXX had a major lawsuit against them for mishandling of cinsumer accounts. I am finding myself currently in a similar situation from the issues that were going on in XX/XX/XXXX with this Bank. 
7. doing this process I have constantly been referred to call the front line clerks about my issues. Both companies REFUSED to provide me with a higher level of contact to address my higher-level of needs on my account. Both agencies line clerks were very LIMITED as to what they could do to help me. BOTH AGENCIES XXXX XXXX XXXX   ALSO VERIFIED THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF DISPUTED BALANCE OR ANY OTHER NEED AS LISTED ON THE ACCOUNT THEY HAD ACCESS TO. I found this very unprofessional of both agencies to "" dump '' this level of concerns on their line workers. 


8. it has become clear that I AM owed money and not the other way around but company s are doing everything possible to not acknowledge this. I DO NOT APPRECIATE ANYONE STEALING FROM ME. 

9. XXXX ADVERTISING PRACTICES AND POLICIES CLEARLY DON'T MATCH WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THE XXXX CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT AND CONSUMERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THIS. 

8. it is very clear that I am the only one working to resolve my issues, while both companies sit back and let my account balance get out of control. I do not want my credit damaged because of their incompetence and I feel that consumers at this point need to be 100 % informed of what's going on. 
Consumers need to closely review their accounts overtime and contact the : The Federal Trade Commission and/or cfpb to what's going on with their accounts. 
Otherwise consumers will continue to be taken advantage of, overcharged for items that they're thinking they're getting sales prices on and will find out there is no reporting process with either company to address acct issues. 
Both companies clearly have no interest in addressing any account issues with the consumers that they serve. 
**What started out with a personal issue with the wrong balance of my account, has now spiraled into much bigger concerns to consumers in general and the issues do need to be addressed immediately.

Vehicle loan or lease,"I have a loan with Ally Financial for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I paid {$6500.00} in XX/XX/XXXX to 'pay ahead ' as I knew I had some financial constraints happening in the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that I was past due for my XX/XX/XXXX payment. When I asked why, I was told due to no payment being received since XX/XX/XXXX. When I explained what I had attempted to do, I was told their company does not recognize 'pay ahead '. I asked why I was n't past due for XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX and no one could give me a reason. I scraped for the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments each of these months, all they considered 'late '. In XX/XX/XXXX, I paid off the loan, less what I thought late fees were. On XX/XX/XXXX, after speaking with an 'offshore ' rep and Supervisor, I was transferred 'onshore ', where I spoke with two reps, all the while arguing to speak with an 'onshore ' Supervisor or Mgr. I was finally transferred to a Mgr line and was told she was n't available and I would have to leave a message. This Mgr called me back within 15 minutes and after listening and empathizing with me, she said she would put this in for late fees to be removed. She also promised me a return call with in the next few weeks. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a second 'onshore ' Mgr, who said the fees were not waived ( which I knew ) and said she would look into this further and call me back. To this day, I have not heard from anyone. I attempted today to call in and requested the number for the customer advocate for Ally, this number was refused to me without my account information and then the rep hung up on me. I would like this to be reviewed to have late charges waived and my credit bureau updated. At this point in time, I will not consider Ally for any future loans. I am beyond upset and frustrated with their non-compliance of my requests.

Bank account or service,"I went to BMO Harris to open an account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. When I inquired about overdrafts, the personal banker XXXX XXXX was confusing the opt-in and opt-out terminology. He stated that opt-out meant my overdrafts would be paid. He said everyone was opted out automatically and they could change to opt-in and not pay overdrafts. I said, "" Really at XXXX they said opt-in meant paying overdrafts. '' I finally forced him to find me a copy of the account terms and conditions he was making me acknowledge receiving. He had no idea what I was requesting and tried to tell me the signature card page I signed was the Deposit Account Agreement and then tried to say the pricing schedule was it. I was persistent that there were additional account terms he had n't provided and they likely called it a handbook. He ran to a different area of the branch to look for one. Why are n't the account opening disclosures available at the desk where they make you open an account? Why does n't the personal banker know what the account agreement is? Finally, when he came back with the booklet ( Deposit Account Agreement ), I quickly flipped to the overdraft section and showed him the page on overdrafts. I read him the line that said opt-in meant paying my overdrafts and I wanted to be opted in. He said, "" Oh, I was confusing the terms, but I can easily check a box to change that. '' I said, "" I do n't have to do anything else? '' and he said, "" no. '' I did not receive a separate notice describing the overdraft practice or a confirmation of opt-in. 

I called the XXXX number to inquire about my opt-in status on XXXX/XXXX/15 since I did n't receive an overdraft confirmation or notice. She confirmed I was opted in. She said most people opt-in online. She could n't explain why I did n't get the disclosures but put me on hold to talk to XXXX at the branch. When the person came back she said XXXX would mail the overdraft disclosures to me. XXXX mailed me the handbook and privacy policy but no overdraft disclosure or confirmation. 

I went to close my account on XXXX/XXXX/15 the Service Manager XXXX XXXX told me that I would be charged a fee if I closed my account, but I could talk to a banker to see about waiving the fee. I explained I was closing my account because they were n't complying with the regulations. The supervisor did n't care to ask what the violation was and he refused to let me withdraw the {$100.00} that was in my account. I was forced to go talk to the same banker who does n't understand overdrafts to get the account closing fee waived and then go back to the teller line to wait for a cashier 's check. I deposited cash and asked for cash to be returned to me, why was I forced to get a cashier 's check. It is hugely surprising that a supervisor is unable to waive a fee or did n't care about the details of a regulatory violation. 

I think this is a problem that has impacted several other customers. The personal banker does n't give out the deposit account agreement unless a person is forceful like I was. He tried to tell me the XXXX page "" Individual Signature Card '' was the agreement. Even after I read the sentence about acknowledging receipt of the Handbook, he was unsure for what I was looking. Neither the personal banker nor the call center agent and XXXX understand what the required process is to comply with the Regulation E overdraft regulations. Then, when I point out their noncompliance and my desire to close my account, they want to charge me a fee. Please protect others ' consumer rights by looking into these overdraft practices.",9,"['went', 'bmo', 'haris', 'open', 'acount', 'xxxx', 'inquired', 'overdraft', 'personal', 'banker', 'xx', 'xx',

Debt collection,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX received an e-mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX from Nationstar Mortgage stating they needed an updated award letter for my XXXX payments so they could complete my request for a modification.. I sent the document back by e-mail on the XXXX of XXXX. 
On the XXXX XXXX at XXXX I received a call from Nationstar stating that request for modification had been denied on the XXXX and that my house was in active forclosure but a sale date had not been set yet. I could avoid it by sending them {$62000.00}. 

Today at XXXXI received another call stating the same thing except the caller wanted {$54000.00}. This caller told me she was calling from the XXXX 's, no wonder we can never get ahold of our dedicated loan specialist. 

Since I was still engaged in my request for a modification on the XXXX of XXXX, How could they have gone through all the legal requirements in two days to have my house in active forclosure status, and be scheduling a sale? 
I believe that this an abusive tactic from Nationstar in violation The New Jersey Fair Debt Collection Act bill # S410 and the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Pub L.95-109. 

I believe that this is an ongoing practice of this company and since they record all their phone calls they should be able to supply you with a transcript of these calls. 

This company should be investigated into their business practices and be made to be held accountable.

Mortgage,"Ocwen continues to wrongfully damage my credit score by erroneously reporting to the credit bureaus that I missed a mortgage payment, when I have not. Because Ocwen raised my escrow amount after buying expensive "" acceptable '' homeowners insurance when I already had good homeowners insurance ( the subject of a previous complaint still being examined by them ), I chose not to pay the increased escrow amount but did pay the old mortgage amount in full each month. When I disputed the increased escrow amount and chose not to pay it ( more than {$400.00} a month extra! ), they told the credit bureaus I had missed a payment, which I had not. Further, they continue to force a hardship on me by demanding I pay the increased escrow amount while this is in dispute, resulting in a total mortgage amount of more than {$2000.00} rather than the {$1600.00} I had been paying for 10 years. In summary, they have damaged my credit and caused me severe financial hardship by raising my mortgage escrow amount unnecessarily ( I sent evidence of my insurance agent 's correspondence with them in a previous complaint ).",0,"['ocwen', 'continues', 'wrongfuly', 'damage', 'credit', 'score', 'eroneously', 'reporting', 'credit', 'bureau', 'mised', 'mortgage', 'payment', 'ocwen', 'raised', 'escrow', 'amount', 'buying', 'expensive', 'aceptable', 'homeowner', 'insurance', 'already', 'god', 'homeowner', 'insurance', 'subject', 'previous', 'complaint', 'stil', 'examined', 'chose', 'pay', 'increased', 'escrow', 'amount', 'pay', 'old', 'mortgage', 'amount', 'ful', 'month', 'disputed', 'increased', 'escrow', 'amount', 'chose', 'pay', 'month', 'extra', 'told', 'credit', 'bureau', 'mised', 'payment', 'continue', 'force', 'hardship', 'demanding', 'pay', 'increased', 'escrow', 'amount', 'dispute', 'resulting', 'total', 'mortgage', 'amount', 'rather', 'ben', 'paying', 'year', 'sumary', 'damaged', 'credit', 'caused', 'severe', 'financial', 'hardship', 'raising', 'mortgage', 'escrow', 'amount', 'unecesarily', 'sent', 'evidence', 'insurance', 'agent', 'corespondence', 'previous', 'complaint']",ocwen continues wrongfuly damage credit score eroneously reporting credit bureau mised mortgage payment ocwen raised escrow amount buying expensive aceptable homeowner insurance already god homeowner insurance subject previous complaint stil examined chose pay increased escrow amount pay old mortgage amount ful month disputed increased escrow amount chose pay month extra told credit bureau mised payment continue force hardship demanding pay increased escrow amount dispute resulting total mortgage amount rather ben paying year sumary damaged credit caused severe financial hardship raising mortgage escrow amount unecesarily sent evidence insurance agent corespondence previous complaint

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I enrolled in a high deductible Health Insurance plan through my employer effective XX/XX/2016.

Capital One received the form and refused to process because the form did not include a Medallion Signature Stamp. I tried to submit the from a second time and took the form to my personal bank, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX representative told me the Transfer form does not require a Medallion Signature Stamp because the funds being transferred were not securities but FIDC insured cash. XXXX XXXX agreed to guarantee my signature and stamp the form which they explained is similar to a Medallion Guarantee Stamp. 
Captial One refused to process the second request to reansfer funds to my HSA because they said the form lacked the Medallion Guarantee Stamp. 
As a final resort I had the funds distributed to my personal checking account and then transferred the funds to my HSA. The problem is this transaction will now appear to be taxable. I feel Capital Ones requirement of the Medallion Signature stamp impeded me from completing the rollover transaction as provided by IRS regulations.

Student loan,"I applied for Loan Forgiveness through XXXX. It seemed to be the only website/provider who is able to process Federal Loan Forgiveness for Public Service providers. It was set up through StudentLoans.gov, so I thought it was a legitimate provider. 

I began to process my application sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, to have it start in XX/XX/XXXX. I just finished it. Everything took months with them. In the mean time, I kept on making ( what now I found out ) as endless payments towards my loans. When I had my loans with XXXX ( good servicer ) I was making {$600.00} for the last 3-5 years. I brough the balance down, despite having XXXX kids to support. I now owe {$50000.00}, graduated XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, and have been making payments for the last 9 years. I worked for XX/XX/XXXX all my life. I am looking to buy a house, so really hoped this process would clear up some cash by the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally told that my payments of 9 years are not valid as I did not have loans with XXXX  since I began to make payments. I needed to sign up for some special payment plan to be eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX. I was never told about this by anyone. And believe me I do paperwork for a living, so I looked all over for this info. This seems to be yet another trap by the big corporations to keep me paying endlessly for loans. 

Just a final note, I made about {$80000.00} last year, married, with XXXX kids. When I did their Income Contingent payment plan I was told I needed to pay over {$900.00} a month ( myself ). When I called XX/XX/XXXX, to see if it can be changed, I was told I could do another, meaningless plan, and pay {$420.00} a month, less than what I paid for the less 9 years. 

I hope you can take my extremely negative experience and find a way to make consumers be able to stop paying endless college loans and invest into the economy. This program seems to be another scam to keep me paying into endless existence. I plan to change my loans to my previous provider and keep my {$600.00} payment as I did before. I will end up paying off my loan within 10 years without this company making money off of me.

Credit card or prepaid card,"My credit card, ( Chase Visa, XXXX ), offers a 3 % rebate on "" Home Improvement '' purchases. I 'm purchasing {$900000.00} approx in hard wood floor, carpeting, and tile for my home. ( {$2000.00} pr month ) They are refusing to give me the 3 % stating that the point of purchase, ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL ), is not listed as "" HOME IMPROVEMENT '', but are listed or classified as "" Flooring and Floor Coverings. '' I 'm sorry, but that is exactly what "" Home Improvement '' is, flooring and floor coverings. While talking to the CS rep. I asked, "" If I buy the same products from XXXX, would it be considered "" HOME IMPROVEMENT? '' She replied, "" Yes, XXXX is considered "" home improvement '', but your store is classified as "" Flooring and Floor Coverings. '' When I asked to be transferred to someone further up the ladder I was told they could not do that. Basically, I 'm being blockaded from speaking to anyone that has the authority to correct the problem. It comes down to how a store is coded and it is the coding that dictates if a purchase gets 3 % or 1 %. They advertise 3 % on "" Home Improvements '', but it 's only if the store is coded as a home improvement store and they dictate how a store is coded. I requested a list of stores that were coded "" Home Improvement '' and they said they could only tell me but not send me a list. They also could not tell me until after the purchase was made. "" Catch XXXX '' They also offer 3 % on gas, but if I buy gas at a XXXX or XXXX convenience store, does it go down as gas at 3 % or general merchandise at 1 %? They 're playing a game and it 's cheating their customers out of a rebate that they deserve. The product is the product regardless of how they deem the store classification. 
This is a classic trick in that they offer no breakdown on the statements as to what the rebate amount is for each purchase and therefore the customer never knows that he is being cheated, or would a term like "" mislead '' be more appropriate. How can I find out the -rebate amount for each and every purchase on my statement, when I get my statement. 
- I spoke to one of the Presidents and an owner of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and explained the situation to him. He was not aware of how they were classified and found my situation disturbing. When I told him they were classified as "" Flooring and floor coverings '', he stated, "" Yes, we are that, but that is also Home Improvement! '' His main concern, other than my situation, is that he could be loosing business to XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX XXXX just because of a coding error or glitch. 
Basically, it comes down to one thing, "" The banks trying to scam their customers. '' It 's as bad as the politicians back in the XXXX trying to get away with stuff that was not legal by saying that XXXX was not a "" WAR '', it was a "" Police Action. '' Hopefully someone who is reading this recalls and knows exactly what I 'm talking about. 
OK, the ball is now in your court. Let 's see where you get in trying to talk to someone that has the authority to make the correct call. This is upsetting me so much I 'm considering going "" VIRAL '' with my complaints. I wish I had a video of my conversations with Customer Service. Especially when I get someone in XXXX or XXXX on the other end of the line. Their refusal to kick me up the ladder to someone with more authority says a lot about their so called "" Customer Service. '' On one previous call I was told that the store was mis-coded and the problem would be corrected. That does not appear to have happened. 
Thanking you in advance for any and all consideration.

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a corporate housing lease agreement, under the umbrella of XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, a structured Nevada corporation with the XXXX XXXX XXXX located in the city of XXXX XXXX, CA. 

Inspite of receiving a three-day notice on XX/XX/XXXX to pay rent or quit, for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and in correlation with being served with a Complaint Unlawful Detainer on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the past due rent for XX/XX/XXXX, along with XX/XX/XXXX rent etc, and as instructed left a XXXX XXXX XXXX cashiers check along with the apartment keys in a drop box, when I completed my move on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, during my initial research of Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP, I located numerous, disparaging reviews, that are consistent with what appears to be unethical and mendacious practices. For example, on XXXX Illegal Collections Kimball Tirey St. John : XXXX : Reviews Kimball Tirey & St. John LLP Complaint : I checked my credit report Sunday evening seeing there was a new debt of almost {$3000.00} placed on. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, - Rip-off Report : Kimball, Tirey & St. John - After 9 years they forged documents and put garnishment on my wages. XXXX By obtaining a copy of my case file, several concerns are raised. For example, on one court document, there is a section which notes that the lease agreement I authorized with XXXX, was entered on XX/XX/XXXX. This date is incorrect. According to a recent letter issued to me by XXXX XXXX, the in-service date on record, is XX/XX/XXXX, whereas XXXX terminated service on Monday XX/XX/XXXX the day after I completed my move. 

Furthermore, according to XXXX XXXX ; a Commercial Real Estate Directs PDF newsletter ; Thursday XX/XX/XXXX ; The property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a XXXX investor group, in a deal brokered by the XXXX XXXX office of XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX. Therefore, raising a concern on whether Kimball as the debt collector ; has the right to collect this debt an behalf of XXXX ( via ) an Evidence of Assignment. 

In my efforts to challenge Kimballs claim, I had hoped to obtain copies of the Cashiers Check I submitted, along with a copy of the original lease and apartment payment history, etc, for example ; but not limited to ; I re-visited the XXXX XXXX location, and was informed the property is now under new management / ownership. XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, I was informed that XXXX has no alliance with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, nor do they have any business dealings with Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP. 

In addition, I was also informed that Kimball would have copies of the original lease, payment history etc. in their records, along with proof of an Evidence of Assignment, to substantiate their claim. Un-fortunately, when I contacted Kimball, Tirey & St. John to inquire of these documents, I was told by their representative We dont have to show you anything as he ended our conversation by disconnecting the call. 

However, around XX/XX/XXXX : nine-years and two months later after my move in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Memorandum of Costs after Judgement Acknowledgement of Credit and Declaration of Accrued Interest, along with a Notice of Change of Address or Other Contact Information from Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP which was mailed to my current address. 

In the interim, around XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; a financial and insurance carrier I submit cases to as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, along with a copy of their reply to a wage garnishment request via XXXX XXXX Sheriffs Office, per the request of Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call, made to my office at XXXX XXXX, from a representative of Kimball, Tirey & St. John, demanding that I make payments toward the judgement against me or else. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received in my mail a wage garnishment order via XXXX Sheriffs Department, per the request of Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP. 

In my opinion, there appears to be a consistent pattern of untimely denigrations exhibited by representatives of Kimball , Tirey & St. John, which in my opinion, is a law firm /collection agency that is financially motivated to perform their task through any means necessary. For example : regarding my case : The Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, presented to the court by Kimball , Tirey & St. John LLP, ( aka ) as Exhibit I ; this document which is dated XX/XX/XXXX in the upper right-hand corner, is not formatted on XXXX letter head, appears to have been re-created, as it shows the covering up of information, while utilizing paper that is initially dated ; XX/XX/XXXX with a fax time stamp of:XXXX,  p.2, located in the footer ; of Exhibit I. 

In my opinion, for the representative of this law firm, to present this document in a court of law, to a highly regarded judge - court appointee, as a blatant act of deception and dis-regard for our judicial system and the very laws they are sworn to uphold and defend and raising the question of Extrinsic or Intrinsic Fraud ( via ) Fabrication of Evidence by an Attorney. 

I am seeking your assistance in investigating this firms suspicious practices. I am confident that there are other incidents ; past and present that are comparable and closely similar. Thank you, for taking time out of your busy schedule to address my inquiry.

Mortgage,"Applied for a loan at Wells Fargo Bank. Locked in to a rate of 4.375 %. After I paid for the appraisal out of pocket, the mortgage representative stated : '' Unfortunately I have some bad news and I wanted to get it to you before I left the office this evening. When we had first taken the loan application the appraised value that was entered was based off of evaluations by pulling property profiles. Upon speaking to you regarding the conservative appraised value, I changed the number in our system to reflect a {$270000.00} value we had spoken about. The unfortunate news centers around the system not saving this new {$270000.00} value which in turn change the pricing. Today we received your appraisal. The value came back higher than anticipated at the number of {$290000.00}. When this information was entered into the system, it in fact did change the pricing which is making it so we would need to charge you, or decrease the cash back by {$1000.00} in order to get you in at 4.375 %.

MY PROOF of adherence to the terms of the original rental lease is as follows : As per the original lease with XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX Monthly payments of {$850.00} were due on the XXXX ( XXXX ) of each month, and considered late on the XXXX ( XXXX ) of each month. 
First of all, the lease payments during my residency did not ever total a monthly amount of {$900.00} ( {$600.00} plus {$300.00} ). Again, as the original lease reads, the monthly rent was a flat {$850.00} ( see attached ) Section 9. TERMINATION OF TENANCY BY RESIDENT Upon the first anniversary of this Lease, the resident may, at any time, thereafter, terminate this agreement by giving the Landlord a written notice of its intention to terminate. The tenancy is then terminated within thirty ( 30 ) days or at the end of the next rental month following receipt of notice, whichever is greater. 

DOCUMENTS INCLUDED : Page one of the Original XXXX XXXX Lease XXXX - Rental termination letter for XXXX XXXX XXXX - Rental payment/final payment for XXXX XXXX XXXX Rental payment for new residency at XXXX XXXX XXXX Rental payment for second month of new residency at XXXX XXXX I, as of yet, have not seen any valid proof of verification of this supposed debt. Nothing of what I have asked for in multiple certified letters has been furnished to me in any way. What I have seen displayed is YOUR willful refusal to provide proper verification as required by law. 

Where is YOUR proof of ACTUAL VERIFICATION of this supposed debt Item? 

Where is YOUR proof of ACTUAL VERIFICATION giving you the right to post this as a negative item to my credit report? 

Where is YOUR documentation!

Debt collection,"I have been negotiating with Fay Servicing since XXXX of 2019, they informed me that the property has been appraised for $ XXXX and made my client get insurance on the property in order to get this short sale approved.

They agreed, and soon after I spoke back to the agent managing this deal, he raised the price from XXXX and asked "" how bad does your buyer want it? '' to now netting $ XXXX, so the offer would have to be around $ XXXX. This was not reasonable for the appraisal on this property came back as $ XXXX. They would not give me the name of the investor, this is the third time a short sale has gone through the whole entire process, only to be shut down at the very last minute because the agents aren't truthful about the numbers. I do not believe they are communicating with the investor because traditionally in a short sale an offer for fair market value is acceptable.

Mortgage,"Hello On XX/XX/XXXX I made a current payment on my mortgage in the amount of XXXX.. I was approved for a short sale program and received two letters dated  XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in which I have enclosed. These letters state while I am selling my property short sale it is not necessary or required to make payments. The short sale is ongoing and my home is to be sold as is. Hurricane Irma arrives in Florida on XX/XX/XXXX and my mobile home sustained damages of $ XXXX..I contacted my insurance company and made a claim. An insurance check was cut for allegedly {$7200.00} and sent to my mortgage company instead of me. I contacted the insurance company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on several occasions inquiring on the whereabouts of the check. Per the insurance company the mortgage company demanded that the insurance check be sent to my mortgage company servicer Select Portfolio Servicing ( known as SPS ). I don't know why this occurred. The insurance check should have been sent to me the borrower since I am being charged monthly for this insurance. I have enclosed documentation whereas the insurance is included in my mortgage payments. I contacted SPS and they claim the check was mailed to me. I never received a check. Then I got these three letters attached dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX disclosing as a condition of cashing the insurance claim check I agreed to complete the repairs and to request an inspection. I never received an insurance check. The check went to SPS as per the insurance company disclosed. Consequently I have lived in this mobile home in deplorable conditions over one year and the repairs still have not been made. The buyers who I sold the home to "" as is "" still signed a contact to purchase the mobile home and 5 acres even after the hurricane and with all the damages. To this day I never received the insurance check due to the mortgage company has not sent it to me nor the insurance company. I am being charged for these insurance premiums monthly. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from my mortgage company SPS disclosing that they approved my short sale ; please see attached letter. I was elated that the short sale was approved and so was my buyers. We were all excited and I began moving. The buyers began preparing to move into the mobile home. However on XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from SPS disclosing the approval letter was sent incorrectly because now the short sale offer was denied by the investor. I am confused an angry with this entire situation. I was current on my loan payments but was told by the mortgage company since I agreed to the short sale not to make any more payments. My credit is awful now and I eventually had to sign a deed in lieu in order to save myself. I never received the insurance check in over a year ; allegedly the check went to my mortgage company when I was the one being charged for the insurance. The short sale was approved as documentation shows yet rescinded since the offer was denied by the investor.I feel betrayed by my mortgage company in so many ways. I even tried to obtain a modification with SPS however the terms and length of the mortgage was outrageous. Please any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax mishandled my information which has led to a breach that puts myself and millions of others at potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with how equifax has handled reporting this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for nearly a month after the breach was detected. I received no email, letter, or phone call and instead had to discover it via social media. 

Going forward equifax should be required to monitor every account and notify victims if any fraud occurs. Credit fraud protection should be mandatory for every account, not an option for us to have deal with. 

This should be rectified firstly by making credit freezing free and refunding everyone who paid for it following this data breach.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","A few months ago I sent some disputes because there was incorrect and incomplete information on my credit report.

It has been at least 2 months since I mailed my letter and I have n't heard back. When I try calling their XXXX number they want a report number before I speak with an agent and since I do n't have one I ca n't speak to anyone.

Well it 's been way more than 30 days and all of the stuff I disputed is still there. I know I can go online and buy a credit monitoring service and try to dispute things online but I thought that Experian is supposed to help me for free!

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a personal college loan through XXXX in NJ. I usually make my monthly payments via credit card. On XX/XX/18 I tried connecting my checking account to the portal to pay via my checking account because I was being charged a fee every time I used my credit card.

A few weeks to a month later I get a notice in the mail that my loan payment is late and that I am delinquent. 

I log on to the XXXX  to find that my checking account payment had been bounced back.

Student loan,"Hello, In 2010 I XXXX  from college and began repaying my student loans. I had federal loans which were consolidated into one subsidized and one unsubsidized. Some payments went into deferment while I was getting my XXXX XXXX XXXX. About 2 years ago, after Navient had become the servicer of these loans, when the loans came out of deferment and I began making payments for all I applied and received approval for an income based repayment plan which also included a 10 year debt forgiveness component because I am working for a XXXX XXXX. I setup monthly automatic payments to be taken out of my checking account. These payments came put monthly without any problem for a good amount of time, I would estimate a year or more. Strangely, without any notice from Navient, and with no indication that it had do to with any issue from my bank, these automatic payments which were setup through navient simply STOPPED. I did not know they had stopped, I did not receive any word that my payments were not being collected, not even any warnings. They have simply stopped collected payments from me. While on my end, in the short term this seemed like a good thing because no one was asking me to pay, in the big picture this hurts me because I believe that it sets back the 10 year timeline of debt forgiveness that by now I should be 2 or 3 years into, through no fault of my own, and through Navients failure to even tell me that I was not paying them. In the business of my schedule as a XXXX   and a father, I have only tried once to find out why the auto payments stopped and to reinstate these payments, but I was not able to get a solution. I am going to make another attempt. But I can't help but wondering if this is related to the larger issues I am seeing in which Navient has received serious allegations for innapropriately handling their business. Is it worth looking more into for this situation, should I pursue further action? Or is my situation not one that would be eligible for correcting?

Checking or savings account,"I rented a vacation apartment online, and upon seeing that the price was more than double the advertised rate, I first attempted to get a refund for the rental through the landlord, but they refused. I called the bank to see if I could cancel the charge to my debit card. I explained to the agent at my bank about what had happened, and asked what my options were. The agent assured me that we could contest the charge and would win. I mentioned that I was hesitant about it, because I would hate to rent a separate property, only to end up having to pay for both down the road. The agent assured me it would n't come to that, and that I should proceed in renting a new place to stay. Sure enough, after the vacation had come and gone ( and we had rented a separate hotel room ), the bank concluded that I had LOST my contest, and would still have to pay the {$730.00}.

Reporting information that you know to be inaccurate or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act 1681s-2. Should you pursue a judgment without validating this debt, I will inform the judge and request that the case be dismissed based on your failure to comply with the FDCPA. 
Finally, if you do not own this debt, I demand that you immediately send a copy of this dispute letter to the original creditor so they are also aware that I dispute the debt.",6,"['dear', 'colector', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'ne', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'believe', 'owe', 'debt', 'say', 'owe', 'pursuant', 'fair', 'debt', 'colection', 'practice', 'act', 'section', 'b', 'validating', 'debt', 'consumer', 'notifies', 'debt', 'colector', 'writing', 'within', 'thirtyday', 'period', 'described', 'subsection', 'debt', 'portion', 'thereof', 'disputed', 'consumer', 'request', 'name', 'adres', 'original', 'creditor', 'debt', 'colector', 'shal', 'cease', 'colection', 'debt', 'disputed', 'portion', 'thereof', 'debt', 'colector', 'obtains', 'verification', 'debt', 'copy', 'judgment', 'name', 'adres', 'original', 'creditor', 'copy', 'verification', 'judgment', 'name', 'adres', 'original', 'creditor', 'mailed', 'consumer', 'debt', 'colector', 'emphasis', 'aded', 'respectfuly', 'request', 'provide', 'folowing', 'amount', 'debt', 'name', 'creditor', 'debt', 'owed', 'verification', 'copy', 'judgment', 'aplicable', 'prof', 'licensed', 'colect', 'debt', 'maine', 'prof', 'last', 'payment', 'made', 'acount', 'aserting', 'right', 'federal', 'state', 'fair', 'debt', 'colection', 'practice', 'act', 'fair', 'credit', 'reporting', 'act', 'including', 'right', 'disputed', 'debt', 'writing', 'within', 'day', 'receipt', 'initial', 'notice', 'must', 'obtain', 'verification', 'debt', 'copy', 'judgment', 'mail', 'item', 'expense', 'ad', 'interest', 'fe', 'except', 'alowed', 'original', 'contract', 'state', 'law', 'atempt', 'colect', 'debt', 'without', 'validating', 'violates', 'fdcpa', 'also', 'advised', 'keping', 'acurate', 'record', 'al', 'corespondence', 'company', 'including', 'recording', 'al', 'phone', 'cals', 'wil', 'hesitate', 'report', 'violation', 'law', 'state', 'atorney', 'general', 'federal', 'trade', 'comision', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'disputed', 'debt', 'therefore', 'validated', 'information', 'concerning', 'debt', 'asumed', 'inacurate', 'acordingly', 'already', 'reported', 'debt', 'creditreporting', 'agency', 'cra', 'credit', 'bureau', 'cb', 'must', 'imediately', 'inform', 'dispute', 'debt', 'reporting', 'information', 'know', 'inacurate', 'failing', 'report', 'information', 'corectly', 'violates', 'fair', 'credit', 'reporting', 'act', 'pursue', 'judgment', 'without', 'validating', 'debt', 'wil', 'inform', 'judge', 'request', 'case', 'dismised', 'based', 'failure', 'comply', 'fdcpa', 'finaly', 'debt', 'demand', 'imediately', 'send', 'copy', 'dispute', 'leter', 'original', 'creditor', 'also', 'aware', 'dispute', 'debt']",dear colector xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx ne xx xx xx believe owe debt say owe pursuant fair debt colection practice act section b validating debt consumer notifies debt colector writing within thirtyday period described subsection debt portion thereof disputed consumer request name adres original creditor debt colector shal cease colection debt disputed portion thereof debt colector obtains verification debt copy judgment name adres original creditor copy verification judgment name adres original creditor mailed consumer debt colector emphasis aded respectfuly request provide folowing amount debt name creditor debt owed verification copy judgment aplicable prof licensed colect debt maine prof last payment made acount aserting right federal state fair debt colection practice act fair credit reporting act including right disputed debt writing within day receipt initial notice must obtain verification debt copy judgment mail item expense ad interest fe except alowed original contract state law atempt colect debt without validating violates fdcpa also advised keping acurate record al corespondence company including recording al phone cals wil hesitate report violation law state atorney general federal trade comision xx xx xx disputed debt therefore validated information concerning debt asumed inacurate acordingly already reported debt creditreporting agency cra credit bureau cb must imediately inform dispute debt reporting information know inacurate failing report information corectly violates fair credit reporting act pursue judgment without validating debt wil inform judge request case dismised based failure comply fdcpa finaly debt demand imediately send copy dispute leter original creditor also aware dispute debt
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/19, a XXXX County sheriff ( XXXX ) that I am familiar with from work, showed up at my current home residence to serve me with papers that I am being sued. XXXX is a close personal co-worker with whom I worked for many years at the XXXX County Department of Human Services. This was the first invasion of privacy violated by this debt collector. Upon opening the paperwork, I learned that I was being sued by the lawfirm of Pressler, Felt & Warshaw.  They apparently had entered a civil law suit against me in my county of XXXX with the very place I am XXXX for ( The XXXX County Courthouse XXXX XXXX XXXX and is very familiar with all XXXX County XXXX ). This was the second invasion of privacy that this lawfirm violated. I read all the information and realized that Pressler, Felt & Warshaw had filed a plea against me that included personal finance information from XXXX XXXX which included the amount I owed as well as my credit score and a back page showing all of my purchases and stores I shopped. This was the third violation of my privacy. XXXX County Courthouse now knows my personal information and is an XXXX that at the time of XX/XX/19 ( when the civil suit was served ) I was XXXX  by. Therefore, all of my co-workers as well as my boss, and higher up 's all know about my debt and when and where I shopped. This personal information should not have been entered into the XXXX I worked for at the time and is a HUGE violation of my rights! Also, there is no clear cut instructions in the lawsuit paperwork. There is no one to contact to find out if I have a hearing to attend and if, any, what time and day that would be. This paperwork is very vague as to any instructions on how to remedy this situation and considering it ruined my XXXX at XXXX County, I now have no way to even pay this debt off.

To bring the total amount due down and months owed. I had just got my pay check so I called last night on XX/XX/2017 to see how much I owed total to bring my current total amount due back to 0. I owed XXXX dollars this morning I woke up to find my car had been repossessed. I called Santander ( my loan company ) to see if I could make my payment of the full amount dude to get my car back and they refused to reinstate my loan after repossession due to failure to maintain timely payments. When it was partially their fault I was behind on my payments in the first place seeing as they never sent me any bills via certified mail. I take responsibility on my part because I should have been more diligent in finding out how much I owe and when payments were due. But I have always paid my bills via certified mail. They refuse to help me in anyway they keep telling me its company policy to not reinstate my vehicle even if I pay the current amount due in total they say they only way they will surrender the car back to me is I pay the loan off in full. I never received a written letter ( notice ) via certified mail notifying me that my car was in default and due for repossession. I live in XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX states in order for the lean company to reposesss your vehicle they must send you a written letter 10 days prior to repossession with the current amount due to give you a chance to pay the amount and keep your car. The company admitted to not sending me this letter stating that va law does not require this and they can come get it when they want. All I want to do is pay my amount due current and continue on with making my payments on time but they do not want to help me do so. Please help me.,5,"['okay', 'fel', 'behind', 'car', 'payment', 'hole', 'begining', 'understanding', 'wil', 'get', 'bil', 'mail', 'stating', 'much', 'owed', 'pay', 'receive', 'leter', 'car', 'payment', 'already', 'past', 'due', 'tried', 'catch', 'best', 'could', 'time', 'made', 'first', 'payment', 'owed', 'total', 'roughly', 'xx', 'dolars', 'paid', 'xx', 'day', 'another', 'xx', 'day', 'later', 'bring', 'total', 'amount', 'due', 'month', 'owed', 'got', 'pay', 'check', 'caled', 'last', 'night', 'xx', 'se', 'much', 'owed', 'total', 'bring', 'curent', 'total', 'amount', 'due', 'back', 'owed', 'xx', 'dolars', 'morning', 'woke', 'find', 'car', 'ben', 'repossed', 'caled', 'santander', 'loan', 'company', 'se', 'could', 'make', 'payment', 'ful', 'amount', 'dude', 'get', 'car', 'back', 'refused', 'reinstate', 'loan', 'reposesion', 'due', 'failure', 'maintain', 'timely', 'payment', 'partialy', 'fault', 'behind', 'payment', 'first', 'place', 'seing', 'never', 'sent', 'bils', 'via', 'certified', 'mail', 'take', 'responsibility', 'part', 'ben', 'diligent', 'finding', 'much', 'owe', 'payment', 'due', 'always', 'paid', 'bils', 'via', 'certified', 'mail', 'refuse', 'help', 'anyway', 'kep', 'teling', 'company', 'policy', 'reinstate', 'vehicle', 'even', 'pay', 'curent', 'amount', 'due', 'total', 'say', 'way', 'wil', 'surender', 'car', 'back', 'pay', 'loan', 'ful', 'never', 'received', 'writen', 'leter', 'notice', 'via', 'certified', 'mail', 'notifying', 'car', 'default', 'due', 'reposesion', 'live', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'state', 'order', 'lean', 'company', 'repose', 'vehicle', 'must', 'send', 'writen', 'leter', 'day', 'prior', 'reposesion', 'curent', 'amount', 'due', 'give', 'chance', 'pay', 'amount', 'kep', 'car', 'company', 'admited', 'sending', 'leter', 'stating', 'va', 'law', 'require', 'come', 'get', 'want', 'al', 'want', 'pay', 'amount', 'due', 'curent', 'continue', 'making', 'payment', 'time', 'want', 'help', 'please', 'help']",okay fel behind car payment hole begining understanding wil get bil mail stating much owed pay receive leter car payment already past due tried catch best could time made first payment owed total roughly xx dolars paid xx day another xx day later bring total amount due month owed got pay check caled last night xx se much owed total bring curent total amount due back owed xx dolars morning woke find car ben repossed caled santander loan company se could make payment ful amount dude get car back refused reinstate loan reposesion due failure maintain timely payment partialy fault behind payment first place seing never sent bils via certified mail take responsibility part ben diligent finding much owe payment due always paid bils via certified mail refuse help anyway kep teling company policy reinstate vehicle even pay curent amount due total say way wil surender car back pay loan ful never received writen leter notice via certified mail notifying car default due reposesion live xx xx xx xx state order lean company repose vehicle must send writen leter day prior reposesion curent amount due give chance pay amount kep car company admited sending leter stating va law require come get want al want pay amount due curent continue making payment time want help please help
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is a complaint against Equifax. Because my personal information was stolen and I was notified that someone tried to apply for a credit card with that information, it was neccesary to freeze my Equifax account. After submitting personal information on their website, I was then denied on-line access to my account until a verification code was sent in the mail. 

After 10 days, I finally received a verification code. I entered it on the Equifax website and then was directed to enter my password. I entered my password then was prompted that I could not access my account until I changed my password. I changed my password then was prompted that I could not access my account at that time and to callk XXXX. I called that number. I was asked to type in my full social security number and other personal informtion, After 10 minutes I was routed to a customer representative at a call center in the XXXX. They said they woild freeze my account. I asked them for access to the Equifax website so that I could check if it was frozen as verification. They said they would send a verification letter in XXXX to XXXX business days. 
So first of all, how is my account that I do not even have access to protected from over-seas hackers in the XXXX, etc. And, if they are indeed freezing my account, How do I unfreezed it of check if someone else asked for it to be unlocked if I can not check the status.

Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX years ago when my son was born, XXXX hospital submitted claims to Valarity , LLC for XXXX bills as collections, within 15 days of his birth. Insurance picked up the bills and they were paid in a timely manner. In XX/XX/XXXX, Valarity XXXX LLC reported these XXXX bills as negative and outstanding collection accounts and I called and spoke with XXXX at Valarity ( repeatedly ) to have these removed from my account. I also spoke with XXXX XXXX at XXXX to confirm that I did n't owe these bills beginning of XXXX, and she said that they should be removed from my XXXX Credit Report and then had XXXX Hospital email Valarity , LLC explaining that these are not bills I owe and should be deleted. Valarity told me then that they were disputing these accounts with XXXX and I also submitted a dispute with XXXX myself. Within 3 days, XXXX of the XXXX accounts were deleted. I waited 10 days and called XXXX to look into another investigation on why the other XXXX were not being deleted and then I waited the recommended 45 day time period with XXXX while calling Valarity again to see why XXXX accounts came back as verified as true debt. At this point, I spoke with XXXX, a supervisor with Valarity , LLC frequently and she was supposed to be helping me get these accounts deleted. I submitted another dispute with XXXX and XXXX of the XXXX accounts were deleted within a week, but the final XXXX were again verified as true debt, only this time they were listed as "" true debt collection, paid in full '' on my credit report causing a drop in my credit score! I called XXXX weekly, sometimes a XXXX times a week to get this matter resolved. She sent me out a letter from Valarity explaining I did n't owe the debt and said it might take up to XXXX XXXX for these last XXXX to be removed ( even though I reminded her that she and XXXX had both said if I never owed these debts that they would by law have to be removed immediately from my report and would take 24 hours to be deleted. ) I began a XXXX investigation with XXXX while it was still in the dispute process with them to have someone look into what was going on. XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX again to inquire why these XXXX debts were listed as closed and the status on my credit report had now listed these as paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for the other and these accounts now said true collection of debt. XXXX told me XXXX XXXX, that her manager would be calling me back right away to help me with this and took my number. No one called me. When I called Valarity a month later, an employee with Valarity told me XXXX was not in that day after taking my name, but when I hung up and called back, another employee transferred me to XXXX right away. XXXX transferred me to her manager XXXX, who assured me she would be calling XXXX herself, and then calling me back on Friday XXXX XXXX XXXX ). XXXX called me back on Friday the XXXX of XXXX and told me she could n't reach XXXX as they were closed by XXXX thurs but would be trying again and personally be handling this to get it resolved and would be calling me back later that day.

Credit card or prepaid card,"American Express enrolled me into an opt-in "" Pay over time '' program without my consent, and did not notify me. As a result, I was charged interest when I submitted payment for what I thought was my statement balance, but was in fact the minimum amount due under the program. 
When I reviewed my next account statement, I noted an interest charge and considered it a mistake on my part for not paying off the full balance. I submitted a payment to cover the full statement balance so that I would no longer be charged interest. 
My current statement now shows another interest charge. I called American Express on XXXX XXXX XXXX and their customer service representative ( XXXX ) advised that even though I had submitted payment in full for my statement balance, the company was going to continue to charge me interest for the previous charges. In effect, these charges are perpetual -- paying off my full balance would only cover the interest calculated for the reported balance, but interest continues to accrue after the statement is delivered and even after they receive payment. The lag between theses systems ensures there 's always a balance due. 
During my call American Express was able to immediately locate the XXXX XXXX XXXX email with their "" Pay over time '' offer, but they can not locate any record of my having enrolled because they do n't keep records from that far back.

A-part one of this new Complaint : It is my right to respond to the above Wells Fargo bank unfounded claims.

1-I never complained to the CFPB about any account ending in XXXX  that Wells Fargo claimed to be an account opened on my name and social security. If it existed then Wells Fargo bank just committed fraud against me and it should be severe more legal consequences to be assumed by this bank.

2- I never made any fraud claim with Wells Fargo for the amounts claimed by this bank as they stated above.

3- without my consent, Wells Fargo bank closed my personal credit account in retaliation and violation of the consumer Protection Act and in violation of OSHA Act Section 11 ( c ) the full account number of my impacted account is XXXX.

thus if Wells Fargo can not prove by clear convincing evidences the opposite of each of all my above response statements then Wells Fargo contend to the violations it committed.

B- Second part of this new complaint : Wells Fargo bank in its Retaliatory new inventions had repeatedly mailing letters from its consumer collection department.

On Friday XX/XX/2019 I called Wells Fargo collection departments and they confirmed to me that I do not owe Wells Fargo anything to be collected from those above collection department at Wells Fargo bank. Therefore, Wells Fargo bank is harassing me, embarrassing me, invading my privacy, forcing me into a state of constant fear. All that I believed Wells Fargo is doing against me to silence me from speaking up about its violations against me or consumers rights.

Wells Fargo deprived me from a source I use to buy vital necessities, Wells Fargo blacklisted against me, now Wells Fargo closing my personal account and sending me letters from collections. If I loose the place I am renting now. Wells Fargo then forcing me to hanger strike and Wells Fargo bank decision makers should be fully criminally legally responsible for that and/or for any harm of any kind to my well being or safety or life.

Wells Fargo assume full legal consequences for its retaliatory actions against me.Wells Fargo assumes full legal and/or criminal liabilities for anything negative that happened or to happen to the complainant. Wells Fargo bank assumes all the legal consequences for its continuous retaliatory adverse actions it committed against XXXX XXXX. This complaint is in defense and response to new alleged claims by Wells Fargo against the rights of XXXX XXXX as cited. All stated herein is to the complainant current states belief, knowledge and understanding and it is all subject to any change or correction of any kind by him only at any time without any notice and without waiving his rights.

Mortgage,"Hello, Approx. 11 years ago, I purchased a home as a first time home buyer. Shortly thereafter, the value of the property dropped well below what was owed on the mortgage. The mortgage is currently with Mr. Cooper/XXXX  XXXX. I continued to pay the mortgage as per my agreed upon contract. However, approx. 5-6 years ago, there was a hardship and reduced income. At that time, the mortgage was current and remains current to this day but I took advantage of the government HAMP modification program to attempt to make this more affordable with my reduced income. I also worked in other ways to reduce my expenses. At the time, I was advised that if I continued to pay on the mortgage per the modified terms that every year I would receive {$1000.00} principal forgiveness. This forgiveness was never applied to my mortgage balance so I called Mr. Cooper/XXXX  earlier this year to address this. When contacting Mr. Cooper, I was originally told that yes, I should have been receiving this forgiveness every year on the anniversary of the approval if the account remained in good standing, which it has. I was told that the research department would look into why I didn't receive the forgiveness. Eventually, I received a response that stated I did not qualify for forgiveness of principal as my monthly housing expenses did not decline enough with the modification. I had never been presented with this stipulation and it was on no paperwork that I signed. I have requested Mr. Cooper send me documentation to verify this stipulation but they have stopped responding. I feel as though I was a victim of a bait and switch by a large mortgage company that feels they can get away with whatever they want. I feel cheated. I work hard and pay all my bills on time and was offered help only to have the rug pulled out from under me. I don't understand why I was told for years that I would receive principal forgiveness but when it comes due, they won't apply it and won't provide me with any paperwork regarding this. It seems as though they are making it up as they go. I have done everything in my power to pay this debt on time and when I get close to being above water, I am done a disservice by the mortgage company and this greatly impacts my living situation.",0,"['helo', 'aprox', 'year', 'ago', 'purchased', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'home', 'buyer', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'value', 'property', 'droped', 'wel', 'owed', 'mortgage', 'mortgage', 'curently', 'mr', 'coperxx', 'xx', 'continued', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'per', 'agred', 'upon', 'contract', 'however', 'aprox', 'year', 'ago', 'hardship', 'reduced', 'income', 'time', 'mortgage', 'curent', 'remains', 'curent', 'day', 'tok', 'advantage', 'government', 'hamp', 'modification', 'program', 'atempt', 'make', 'afordable', 'reduced', 'income', 'also', 'worked', 'way', 'reduce', 'expense', 'time', 'advised', 'continued', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'per', 'modified', 'term', 'every', 'year', 'would', 'receive', 'principal', 'forgivenes', 'forgivenes', 'never', 'aplied', 'mortgage', 'balance', 'caled', 'mr', 'coperxx', 'earlier', 'year', 'adres', 'contacting', 'mr', 'coper', 'originaly', 'told', 'yes', 'ben', 'receiving', 'forgivenes', 'every', 'year', 'aniversary', 'aproval', 'acount', 'remained', 'god', 'standing', 'told', 'research', 'department', 'would', 'lok', 'receive', 'forgivenes', 'eventualy', 'received', 'response', 'stated', 'qualify', 'forgivenes', 'principal', 'monthly', 'housing', 'expense', 'decline', 'enough', 'modification', 'never', 'ben', 'presented', 'stipulation', 'paperwork', 'signed', 'requested', 'mr', 'coper', 'send', 'documentation', 'verify', 'stipulation', 'stoped', 'responding', 'fel', 'though', 'victim', 'bait', 'switch', 'large', 'mortgage', 'company', 'fels', 'get', 'away', 'whatever', 'want', 'fel', 'cheated', 'work', 'hard', 'pay', 'al', 'bils', 'time', 'ofered', 'help', 'rug', 'puled', 'understand', 'told', 'year', 'would', 'receive', 'principal', 'forgivenes', 'come', 'due', 'wil', 'aply', 'wil', 'provide', 'paperwork', 'regarding', 'sems', 'though', 'making', 'go', 'done', 'everything', 'power', 'pay', 'debt', 'time', 'get', 'close', 'water', 'done', 'diservice', 'mortgage', 'company', 'greatly', 'impact', 'living', 'situation']",helo aprox year ago purchased home first time home buyer shortly thereafter value property droped wel owed mortgage mortgage curently mr coperxx xx continued pay mortgage per agred upon contract however aprox year ago hardship reduced income time mortgage curent remains curent day tok advantage government hamp modification program atempt make afordable reduced income also worked way reduce expense time advised continued pay mortgage per modified term every year would receive principal forgivenes forgivenes never aplied mortgage balance caled mr coperxx earlier year adres contacting mr coper originaly told yes ben receiving forgivenes every year aniversary aproval acount remained god standing told research department would lok receive forgivenes eventualy received response stated qualify forgivenes principal monthly housing expense decline enough modification never ben presented stipulation paperwork signed requested mr coper send documentation verify stipulation stoped responding fel though victim bait switch large mortgage company fels get away whatever want fel cheated work hard pay al bils time ofered help rug puled understand told year would receive principal forgivenes come due wil aply wil provide paperwork regarding sems though making go done everything power pay debt time get close water done diservice mortgage company greatly impact living situation

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.

I have asked them several times to supply me the written SIGNED contractual agreement with them and XXXX showing my signature on any agreement and they WILL not or CAN NOT supply me with that. They simply send me copies of bills or statements and this does not constitute any kind of validation of this debt being mine. Statements and Bills do not show proof of ownership. They recently sent me a letter stating that I do not have a right to challenge their stance and that any written letter to them will be ignored and considered answered already. The burden of proof is on them to show that I am the legal owner of this account that they purchased. Unfortunately they are a 3rd part collection agency that purchase the debt from XXXX but that does not legally give them the right to try to collect from me as I HAVE NO CONTRACT with them.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I ordered a XXXX 49 inch Model number XXXX from the XXXX at XXXX XXXX   XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX for {$760.00}. I arranged for myself to pick it up on XX/XX/XXXX at the XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I received an e-mail from XXXX XXXX that my order was picked up. I did not pick up this item nor did I give anyone consent to pick it up for me. I called as soon as I saw the e-mail but they were already closed I went to the XXXX XXXX location at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX the following day to straighten this matter out. I explained to the manager XXXX that I never picked up my order or authorized anyone to pick it up for me. She stated that she was going to look at the video from the night before and that she would follow up with me the following day. She also asked for my drivers license that day and made a copy. 
The following day I never received a phone call and on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX, I returned to this location. The manager XXXX stated that she reviewed the video and that it looked like it was me that picked up the order and the person provided my id. I asked to see the video but she refused to show me. I asked to speak to a District Manager but she stated he was on vacation. I went straight to the closest police station ( XXXX precinct ) and the person at the front desk told me that it is a civil matter between myself and XXXX XXXX and unfortunately they would not be able to help me. They told me the best thing for me to do is get in contact with my credit card company which I did when I got home that day. 
It is obvious to me that this was an inside theft by XXXX XXXX   employees. No one knew that I had ordered a TV, and I have never lost a drivers license. I have never had any issue like this before. I have been a loyal Capital One customer for 12 years and expect Capital One to fight for me on my behalf.

XXXX had put somewhere in some paperwork that my house was worth {$90000.00} the appraisal came back for {$73000.00} I would have never estimated so high but somehow she came up with that *she also lied to me and told me that the APR was 4.7 when he was actually 5.6 for the proposed loan she actually lied to me twice and told me I was approved for the loan obviously because I 'm not, she misled me to believe I was approved, I did not have to agree to do the appraisal, had I known I was denied but she lied to me and told me that I was approved. Now she refuses to respond to correspondence in her company is not cooperating and giving me my money back. It 's already been a month she told me and the borrower that we will be closing in 2 weeks so I could give the money back with the cash out and it 's been over a month now, I still have to pay back that money to the borrower They Do n't Really Care that the loan did n't go through she said we will be closing in two weeks and so I was expected to pay this money back in 2 weeks unaware that being so misleading was part of professional courtesy. For now the law and compliance Department of XXXX XXXX mortgage is doing an investigation on recorded phone calls to see if she told me that she would give me a refund on my denial.

Credit card or prepaid card,"The purpose of this letter to lodge a complaint against Citibank. The end of XX/XX/XXXX, I called the credit card company to verify if I was eligible for a credit card promotion. You receive XXXX XXXX air miles points if you spend {$3000.00} dollars within the first 3 months of opening a new card. You are not eligible if you open or close a card within the last 24 months, hence the reason I called customer service to verify if I was eligible. I had made this mistake 2 years prior, when they changed the policy from an 18 month to a 24 month waiting period to qualify without my knowledge. I didn't receive the XXXX bonus miles, although I spent the required XXXX dollars. I try to learn from my mistakes so I wanted to make sure I qualified this time and that I indeed had gone past the two year waiting period. The woman at Citibank 's customer service office confirmed that I had, so I applied for a new card which I received in the beginning of XXXX. 
By the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I had spent the required XXXX XXXX dollars. I checked my account and noticed the XXXX points had not been posted to my airline miles account with XXXX XXXX. I called to find out why and was told I wasn't getting XXXX points because the customer service person I spoke to in XXXX had apparently made a mistake. I was shocked. I feel like I have been duped into spending a lot of money for nothing. I asked to speak to a supervisor and then a manager both times told it's unfortunate but they can't do anything to rectify the situation. I demanded to speak to someone else and they said they would have another higher up manager call me from the review department. That was supposed to be within 24-48 hours. They never called. 
I do not feel I should be paying for their mistake, especially when I made sure this time I was doing everything correctly and was told I qualified. If I had been told the correct information I simply would have waited until I was qualified to open a new card. I was denied that option with the wrong information. Now I have to wait another 2 years ( a total of 4 ) to qualify for a new bonus program. We are talking about points not currency. In lieu of good customer service, they should own up to their mistake and award me with the XXXX points I deserve.",3,"['purpose', 'leter', 'lodge', 'complaint', 'citibank', 'end', 'xxxx', 'caled', 'credit', 'card', 'company', 'verify', 'eligible', 'credit', 'card', 'promotion', 'receive', 'xx', 'xx', 'air', 'mile', 'point', 'spend', 'dolars', 'within', 'first', 'month', 'opening', 'new', 'card', 'eligible', 'open', 'close', 'card', 'within', 'last', 'month', 'hence', 'reason', 'caled', 'customer', 'service', 'verify', 'eligible', 'made', 'mistake', 'year', 'prior', 'changed', 'policy', 'month', 'month', 'waiting', 'period', 'qualify', 'without', 'knowledge', 'receive', 'xx', 'bonus', 'mile', 'although', 'spent', 'required', 'xx', 'dolars', 'try', 'learn', 'mistake', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'qualified', 'time', 'inded', 'gone', 'past', 'two', 'year', 'waiting', 'period', 'woman', 'citibank', 'customer', 'service', 'ofice', 'confirmed', 'aplied', 'new', 'card', 'received', 'begining', 'xx', 'end', 'xxxx', 'spent', 'required', 'xx', 'xx', 'dolars', 'checked', 'acount', 'noticed', 'xx', 'point', 'ben', 'posted', 'airline', 'mile', 'acount', 'xx', 'xx', 'caled', 'find', 'told', 'geting', 'xx', 'point', 'customer', 'service', 'person', 'spoke', 'xx', 'aparently', 'made', 'mistake', 'shocked', 'fel', 'like', 'ben', 'duped', 'spending', 'lot', 'money', 'nothing', 'asked', 'speak', 'supervisor', 'manager', 'time', 'told', 'unfortunate', 'anything', 'rectify', 'situation', 'demanded', 'speak', 'someone', 'else', 'said', 'would', 'another', 'higher', 'manager', 'cal', 'review', 'department', 'suposed', 'within', 'hour', 'never', 'caled', 'fel', 'paying', 'mistake', 'especialy', 'made', 'sure', 'time', 'everything', 'corectly', 'told', 'qualified', 'ben', 'told', 'corect', 'information', 'simply', 'would', 'waited', 'qualified', 'open', 'new', 'card', 'denied', 'option', 'wrong', 'information', 'wait', 'another', 'year', 'total', 'qualify', 'new', 'bonus', 'program', 'talking', 'point', 'curency', 'lieu', 'god', 'customer', 'service', 'mistake', 'award', 'xx', 'point', 'deserve']",purpose leter lodge complaint citibank end xxxx caled credit card company verify eligible credit card promotion receive xx xx air mile point spend dolars within first month opening new card eligible open close card within last month hence reason caled customer service verify eligible made mistake year prior changed policy month month waiting period qualify without knowledge receive xx bonus mile although spent required xx dolars try learn mistake wanted make sure qualified time inded gone past two year waiting period woman citibank customer service ofice confirmed aplied new card received begining xx end xxxx spent required xx xx dolars checked acount noticed xx point ben posted airline mile acount xx xx caled find told geting xx point customer service person spoke xx aparently made mistake shocked fel like ben duped spending lot money nothing asked speak supervisor manager time told unfortunate anything rectify situation demanded speak someone else said would another higher manager cal review department suposed within hour never caled fel paying mistake especialy made sure time everything corectly told qualified ben told corect information simply would waited qualified open new card denied option wrong information wait another year total qualify new bonus program talking point curency lieu god customer service mistake award xx point deserve

Vehicle loan or lease,"XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To whom it may concern : I am writing to complain about the service I have received from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX  ). In XXXX, I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from the above mentioned company. The Vehicle was returned to XXXX XXXX, located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, since the lease was ending on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a statement with a balance of {$790.00} due by XX/XX/XXXX .The statement shows the following breakdown : {$390.00} Disposition fee, which I was aware of and have already succesfully processed the payment. 
{$400.00} for Excess Wear and Use. 
On XX/XX/XXXX when I have returned the vehicle, I was assisted by XXXX, the only representative at the "" Lease-End '' department in XXXX XXXX XXXX location. I was never offered a day or a time for the inspection prior to the vehicle return by her. I was advised only to drop off the vehicle at the location mentioned above and that she will assist me with the rest of the process. Per XXXX 's initial inspection the vehicle was in a good condition, she stated there should not be any additional charges besides the disposition fee of {$390.00}. Upon receiving the statement I called the XXXX Quality Control Department on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to representative named XXXX, who was very unprofessional in handling my complaint, he was rude and sarcastic. All he said, was if I do not agree with the statement and if I do not believe I caused any damages to the car, I need to transfer the balance to anyone I believe is responsible for it, which did not make any sense to me. He also stated that XXXX 's job is to bill clients, and not to assist with such an issue. After that I have explained him that I have taken pictures of the vehicle at the dealership parking lot on the day of the return ( please see attached pictures below ) and that pictures clearly indicate no damages of any kind. Only after that he advised me to go into XXXX XXXX XXXX enter the vehicle VIN number ( XXXX ) and the account number ( XXXX ) to check pictures of the inspected vehicle and the inspection report, that shows 3 different types of damages which are : 1. LF Carpet Burn Hole 1/8 '' to 1/2 '' 2. LT Rocker Panel Outer Dent/No Paint Dmg 3 '' to 4 '' 3. RF Wheel Curb Rash 7 '' to 8 '' After that I advised XXXX, that I do not recognize none of the damages and they clearly contradict with pictures I have taken on XX/XX/XXXX ( day of the return ). 
The website pictures were uploaded on the day of inspection XX/XX/XXXX, which is 8 days after I have returned the vehicle. He only suggested to contact the dealership directly, since he could not assist me any further, He also mentioned that the dealership should be held responsible, since the vehicle was in their posession for that period of 8 days from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Following his advise I called the dealership, and was transferred again to XXXX. XXXX has told me that the dealership can not help me with anything since they do not have the vehicle in their possession anymore, and I need to call the inspection company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) The representative at XXXX XXXX XXXX has transferred me back to XXXX, stating that the owner of the vehicle and the company that is sending out the statement is XXXX and I need to deal with them. I have been dealing with this issue since then. Noone is willing to give me any explanation of : 1. why the vehicle was not thoroughly inspected on the day of return XX/XX/XXXX and I was not issued a copy of the inspection report? 
2. why was the vehicle inspected 8 days after it was returned? 
3. why I was never offered an option to be present at the time of the inspection ( even though it was conducted 8 days after the return )? 
4. who is responsible for the vehicle after it has been returned. 
None of the above mentioned companies are willing to assist me with the issue I am facing. XXXX representatives are not willing to assist me in any way, however, they have sent me another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX, notifying me that if I do not make a payment of {$790.00}, ( {$390.00} of which has been already paid ) they will utilize a collection agency to collect the payment. Since none of the above mentioned company representatives are willing to communicate to each other or get on a conference call to clear the issue, it makes it impossible for me to resolve the problem I am facing. Realizing that this may damage my credit history as well, I seek for your help. If I do not get help from XXXX and resolve this issue quickly, I will have no choice but to seek the help of an attorney to go after all parties that are involved in this mess, that caused me so much emotional distress and can possibly damage my credit. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you.

I also requested that all equipment be mailed to his house since I had just been robbed and I work 13-hour days, I did not want to take the chance of my equipment being taken again. XXXX agreed to assist me with the purchasing of the equipment. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a document stating that I would receive a payment of {$7600.00}. I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX where he explained that the total amount for the settlement was {$10000.00} but {$2900.00} was taken for Recoverable Depreciation and that I would get the remainder of the money when I provided receipts of purchasing my equipment. This is the first time that Recoverable Depreciation  was brought to my attention. In the document sent to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 4 USAA states Policy language allows the insured to collect RD as replacements are completed. What policy language? What does policy language mean? i am not a business or corporation nor am I an insurance company. Policy language is a foreign concept to me. Pages 8 through 9 of the RENTERS POLICY USAA provides a list of definition, why did USAA chose to not include recoverable depreciation in the list of definitions? Why did USAA only provide a definition to recoverable depreciation after a policy holders ( me ) loss and after the first payment? Since XXXX was the one purchasing equipment for me through his account so that I could get the discounts offered to him I asked him to contact XXXX and asked them to put my name on the receipt. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX two payments through XXXX. However, we ran into some difficulties when XXXX would not release the funds. XXXX had told me that XXXX stated that the funds had not been released I then informed XXXX that this information was not true and the money had already been taken out of my account. XXXX also stated that XXXX told him that payment for equipment was noted in the transaction, a note that I did not provide. That the money would not be released until he gave me the equipment. If USAA bank removed the money from my account but did not give it to XXXX until they could verify that i got my equipment. Then how did XXXX XXXX know that the money was meant to be used for purchasing my equipment when USAA bank and XXXX XXXX are two different corporations under two different CEOs? Currently the issue is still being looked at. With that in mind the continuation of payment for the remaining balance is to be submitted by me to XXXX by cash or check. I require USAA to show me where in the original policy titled RENTERS POLICY PACKET does it state that I am not allowed to have assistance in the purchasing of my loss? XXXX provided me with one receipt from XXXX totaling {$14000.00} that I then submitted to USAA on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached document ). In the document that USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 5 USAA claims that I submitted two receipts totaling {$16000.00}. This is false, I submitted one receipt totaling {$14000.00} from XXXX. Where did USAA get the second receipt from? Who submitted a second receipt with the use of my information? I require USAA to submit to me the second receipt totaling {$2300.00} in which USAA states they received from me. I also request documentation of how the second receipt was submitted. On XX/XX/XXXX USAA sent me a document that a payment of {$1600.00} would be posted on my account. I then called USAA and asked why I was only receiving {$1600.00} instead of the remaining {$2900.00}. The USAA employee told me that an investigation would be submitted to the claims department for the remainder of my money. In the document USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 5 USAA claims a referral was submitted as our RD claim review yielded the following. An invoice provided by XXXX XXXX was purchased under a business name, subsequent to her confirming the XXXX stolen for her personal use only. This is misleading information for I was the one who asked for an investigation because I was only given {$1600.00} instead of {$2900.00}. The Special Investigation Unit was not contacted due to my receipt being under a business name for if that were the truth the payment of {$1600.00} would have never been given. The Special Investigation Unit only became involved when I requested for further investigation. Why would I submit a request for investigation if I am misrepresenting myself? Why did USAA release the amount of {$1600.00} in the first place if I was misrepresenting my use of equipment? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that the payment of {$1600.00} was cancelled. I once again called USAA and asked why the money was being taken back, the USAA employee stated that it was due to the claim being under investigation. I found it strange that they would take the money back, because I was the one who asked for the investigation. I then asked the employee if i would receive my full amount after the investigation is done in which she replied yes. This cancellation of payment put me behind on my payments to XXXX. Lucky for me XXXX is a fair and understanding man, him and I created a payment plan where I could finish paying out the rest of the equipment. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call in which the document titled NOTICE : OF HARASSMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA speaks of ( see attached document ) I was asked an abundance of personal and inappropriate questions during this conversation. The document USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 7 USAA states The allegation XXXX XXXX was asked inappropriate questions was also unfounded, how is asking me if I know anyone who wants to cause me harm an appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? How does this help your investigation on why I did not receive full payment? How is asking me if I had deliveries made to my home during the time frame of the theft and appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? How is asking me who comes into my home, an appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? How is asking me why I did not contact management of my apartment complex or contact neighbors and investigate on my own the loss of my equipment and appropriate question for an insurance company to ask? When I did not want to answer a question USAA would ask me if there was a reason I did not want to answer the question making the list of questions and interrogation, how is it appropriate for an insurance company to interrogate its policy holders and victims? I require USAA to provide me with documentation stating that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is also a detective agency in which USAA is allowed to conduct a further investigation without the police. 
In the document sent to Nevada Division of Insurance  paragraph 6 USAA states On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX provided a recorded statement to the SIU Investigator and confirmed her new artist name was used to purchase the XXXX. This is false, in the conversation of XX/XX/XXXX I was asked who XXXX was? In which I responded that it was my XXXX name. I did not state that my XXXX name was used to purchase the equipment and even if it was, my XXXX name is nothing more than a second identity it is not a business or corporation and I stated that in the conversation as well as in writing ( see NOTICE : OF HARASSMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA XXXX. I require USAA to provide me with the documentation as well as a copy of the recording from that conversation where I state that I am a business/corporation. 
The SIU investigator also asked me if i were to get my equipment back would i let USAA know? I responded by asking why would i have to let USAA know? She states that it is because USAA has a financial investment in the loss. What financial investment? How does USAA have a financial investment in my loss? How does USAA have a financial investment in my equipment? How does USAA have a financial investment in my money and name? Furthermore, where doe USAA get the funds to pay me? Where is that money now since USAA took it out of my private and personal banking account? Who did USAA pay the money too? was it XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX? Where does the remainder of my money go if USAA does not give it to me? I require USAA to send me the original recording of the XX/XX/XXXX phone conversation. 
Towards the end of that conversation I asked the SIU investigator why I was being asked all these questions she responded that is was due to the name XXXX being on the receipt. Again, I was confused what does my XXXX name also being on the receipt have to do with anything. This statement was the closest explanation that I have received from USAA as to why my money was taken from me, and it was not even an explanation they simply said because the name XXXX was included in the receipt. In the document submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance  from USAA paragraph 7 USAA states XXXX XXXX allegations she was given monies and it taken back without explanation is unfounded we told XXXX XXXX the reasoning of the EFT reversal of her RD payments. This is false, in fact if it were not for Nevada Division of Insurance I would still not know that USAA took my money because USAA came to a conclusion that I was using my equipment for business and not personal. I require that USAA send me the documentation in which they explained to me that the money in the amount of {$1600.00} was taken from my account due to a misrepresentation of use of equipment. I also require that USAA provide me with proof that I received that document. 
After I submitted NOTICE : OF HARASSMENT AND INSURANCE FRAUD CAUSED BY USAA to USAA XXXX XXXX contacted me. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX requested that I provided proof of payment and my XXXX and XXXX taxes. I of free will provided XXXX XXXX with my XXXX but did not understand why I needed to provide proof of payment when I had already provided it. When I told XXXX XXXX that I already provided proof of payment she responded with We have the receipt for the replacement of equipment, but need your proof of payment for that equipment. ( see attached document ) This response made no sense to me because in that same document sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM AND DEMAND FOR PAYMENT under point 1 it states Proof of purchase and/or proof of payment for your stolen items. This can include, but is not limited to receipt, invoice, .. I provided them with what their document states counts as proof of payment so What exactly was USAA asking for? On the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT page 2 section d I asked USAA why is it that they needed more information from me when I provided them with the receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. USAA did not respond. Why did USAA not respond? 
In the document submitted by USAA to Nevada Division of Insurance Paragraph 6 USAA states On XX/XX/XXXX, the SIU Investigator requested all proof of payment for the XXXX replacements, and tax returned from XXXX XXXX. Subsequently, she provided her XXXX tax returns to SIU Investigator for further evaluation As stated earlier I willingly provided my XXXX tax return to USAA, so that they could see that I do not make money from my music. That it is nothing more than therapeutic release. 
The response to receiving my XXXX taxes was to submit my XXXX tax returns. I then submitted in writing to USAA that I would not be providing them with anymore private information under the Privacy Act of XXXX. Every time I was compliant USAA would ask me for more private information. Due to my mental health illness I did not work in XXXX, I sustained myself with my basic housing allowance provided to me by my Post XXXX XXXX XXXX and my XXXX check both of which are nontaxable. Hence, I had no tax returns to provide. In the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT page 2 section d I requested USAA to provide me with a valid reason for needing this information, USAA did not reply. Why did USAA not reply to me? How did USAA determine that oracle was correlated to a business when my XXXX taxes clearly show that it does not? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT. This was sent by both mail and through the message board on my USAA claims account. In this document I provided USAA with FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND PRIVACY ACT REQUEST, where I requested the USAA provide me with all the information they had, USAA did not respond. I also provided in the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT proof of me, XXXX XXXX XXXX as a living being ( see document FOR THE CLAIMANTS- KNOWLEDGE OF THS LIVE-LIFE WITH THIS CLAIM BY THIS CLAIMANT ) to prove to USAA that i XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX am not a business or corporation but a human being in flesh and blood. I also stated in the document titled INFORMATION CONCERNING MY CLAIM SETTLEMENT DEMAND FOR PAYMENT page 2 second to last paragraph that I would not be providing USAA with the information of private citizens. 
In the XX/XX/XXXX phone call the SIU investigator asked me if I was working with someone. I stated no, and I stand by that response. I was not and am not working with anyone. I have people who help me which I explained earlier but I do not work with anyone. To work with someone means to get paid which I have stated several times throughout the months that I do not get paid for my music, to receive help is voluntary. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a document through USAA message board titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM stating that On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and Pro Audio and they advised that the receipt that you submitted was not a legitimate receipt and the order number does not match the document you submitted to XXXX XXXX. They also stated that their letterhead was incorrect on the invoice and located a quote that matched your invoice that was given to another person. Yet in the document submitted by USAA to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 6 USAA states The SIU investigation yielded the following ; the invoice in questions was not provided by the store listed on it. Hence, XXXX XXXX RD claim was denied for misrepresentation. Which one is it? Is USAA not paying me because the quote of my invoice was given to another person or is USAA not paying me because the invoice was not provided by the store listed on it? If the store wasn't the right store then where did USAA get the information that the invoice was given to another person? 
Furthermore, which receipt/invoice is USAA talking about? Are they referring to the one I submitted from XXXX which is where the equipment was purchased from or is USAA referencing the second receipt that I did not submit yet they somehow have? Also if the receipt was under another person or the invoice was not provided by the store listed than where did USAA come to the conclusion that i XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  am a business? Every equipment in that receipt is in my possession I have pictures as well as serial number that can be given at any time upon request but USAA has never requested for that information. I require USAA to submit to me the documentation in which XXXX   stated all of the above information. I require USAA to send me all documents in which they were able to create the conclusion that I was using my equipment for business use and not personal. 
In the document submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance from USAA Paragraph 4 USAA states Policy language allows the insured to collect RD as replacements are completed. As long as the actual amount incurred exceeds the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paid on the line item , RD can be released up to the estimated amount or the actual amount spent, whichever is less. This statement is false, in the document titled RENTERS POLICY PACKET page 20 first paragraph of loss settlement it states, We will pay the full cost of repair or replacement, subject to all policy provisions. No deduction will be made for depreciation. 
Why did USAA deduct depreciation from my settlement if the contract itself states that they will not? In that same document page 8 under definition of actual cash value it states actual cash value means the replacement cost of property at the time of loss less a deduction for depreciation based on its age and usage.. USAA contradicted itself within its own document by first stating that depreciation is taken from the actual cash value and then stating that depreciation will not be taken under loss settlement. Which one is it USAA? 
In the document submitted by USAA to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 7 USAA states Lastly, her assertion an illegal search and seizure was conducted and is unfounded, as we acted in accordance with the renters policy, specifically the Duties after Loss excerpt. Then USAA provided Nevada Division of Insurance with 10 out of the 50 page RENTERS POLICY PACKET and highlighted the Duties after Loss section. The Duties after Loss excerpt does not state what USAA is required/allowed to do but only states what I must do after my loss. How can the Duties After Loss excerpt be a form of defense against illegal search in seizure when this excerpt only pertains to what I must do within the policy? 
On the document titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM dated XX/XX/XXXX a letter also sent to Nevada Division of Insurance by USAA the first sentence under Factual Summary states On XX/XX/XXXX, you advised that your residence was broken into and your studio was robbed. I told USAA that my apartment was broken into and my studio equipment was stolen. Not that my studio was robbed. i do not have a studio i only have studio equipment. The document that USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance paragraph 2 USAA states, XXXX XXXX reported that on XX/XX/XXXX her studio residence was burglarized. What studio residence? i don't even know what a studio residence is. 
What is a studio residency? Where did USAA get this idea that my studio residence was robbed or that my studio was robbed when the police report itself states that the robbery took place in my residence/home ( see attached document )? I provided a copy of my lease to show that i live in an apartment as well as the floor plans that my apartment complex rents out. To show that studio residence is not a space that is rented through them. Here is my property managers information XXXX XXXX in case USAA needs to verify that i am renting a one bedroom apartment. I require USAA to submit to me the document in which I state that I have a studio residence. 
Lastly, who is XXXX XXXX? The document from USAA submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance was written by a XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is not XXXX XXXX XXXX who I have addressed in my documents. I have never spoken to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX has not contacted me. How can someone speak on behalf of USAA in a claim that they have nothing to do with? 
How can someone other than the President speak on behalf of USAA on a claim they have nothing to do with? Where did XXXX XXXX receive the information from? Did XXXX XXXX investigate the claim? Did XXXX XXXX listen to the voice recording? Did XXXX XXXX read the documents sent back and forth between USAA employees and myself? Did XXXX XXXX speak to XXXX? 
XXXX XXXX was not involved with this case until the documentation to Nevada Division of Insurance was submitted. Considering that XXXX XXXX provided no supporting documents to any of the conversation between USAA and I that is stated in the document it is safe to assume that all the information acquired is hearsay, which an insurance company is not allowed to do. 
I am the victim here, I was violated and robbed within my own home and then I was violated and robbed through my insurance company who under oath agreed to uphold the constitution in my protection. USAA has given me excuse after excuse for not paying me in full such as due to the hurricanes on the east coast they fell behind with their claims, because the name XXXX  was on the receipt, to lastly the receipt that I provided was false. I am not using the equipment for the business but for personal. I provided USAA with evidence that I do not make money from my music such as my tax return from XXXX. 
Then USAA stated that the receipt I provided was false and even then, USAA did not state that the equipment is not in my possession. USAA provided nothing more than a story to Nevada Division of Insurance, USAA provided no supporting documents to any of the conversations they claimed we had in which I admitted to being a corporation/business, USAA did not provide conversations submitted back and forth between USAA and I ( information that I have provided, see attached documents ), USAA withheld information from Nevada Division of Insurance, USAA provided fraudulent information to Nevada Division of Insurance, USAA attempted to defame my good name with Nevada Division of Insurance, and USAA provided misleading information to Nevada Division of Insurance. 
USAA created a corporation in my name XXXX XXXX XXXX without my consent or permission. And are now attempting to state that i created the corporation. It was not until the last document that USAA provided me and Nevada Division of Insurance titled INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CLAIM where they changed my name to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Why did USAA not change my name in the previous documents they submitted to me but changed it in the only document they submitted to Nevada Division of Insurance? Why did USAA only change my name when Nevada Division of Insurance became involved? Is this a part of the Cestui Que Trust? 
I demand that USAA provide me with every document I requested in this document as well as a response to all questions in writing within 10 days upon receipt. For verification and validation, I require a wet signature from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the response. Failure to answer all question, provide all documents, and a wet signature from XXXX XXXX XXXX by default will be an admission of guilt and wrongdoing. 
If USAA does not provide me with this information, I demand payment in full for the {$14000.00} minus the {$7600.00} already paid and the {$250.00} deductible totaling {$6500.00} to be sent to me by check through XXXX mail. I also demand USAA to cancel my renters policy insurance. For these are the causes of injury that must be cured. I also request that Nevada Division of Insurance fine USAA for the violation of codes listed on the attached document. This Claim/affidavit was submitted to [ XXXX ] XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX [ XXXX ] on XXXX XXXX and has yet to be resolved. 

I must reiterate that they USAA stated to me during a phone conversation with SUI investigator she stated that USAA had an investment in me and my property. Such is false and i demand to see all records that which at anytime USAA have tendered a bond or payments received from the US Treasury and or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in any amount paid out to USAA.",1,"['woman', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'flesh', 'blod', 'corporation', 'busines', 'human', 'theftlos', 'equipment', 'xxxx', 'personal', 'use', 'theftlos', 'contacted', 'reported', 'xx',

Debt collection,"I am getting repeated phone calls by Jefferson Capital. Jefferson Capital is masking their phone number to reflect an area code in "" XXXX Florida '' where I'm from and have family & friends residing. Jefferson Capital is not located in Florida and they are masking their phone number with the hope of me or any 3rd party being tricked in answering the call. Furthermore, Jefferson Capital is calling 3rd parties in trying to contact me. Both tactics I just described confirms the knowingly & willingly act by Jefferson Capital violating my rights under the FDCRA & FCC.

I previously sent Jefferson Capital a letter requesting for them to inform me in writing of what alleged debt they are trying to collect because I am unaware of any outstanding debt that I owe to any creditor. I also requested that if they are making any allegation of any outstanding debt that they are trying to collect to please provide me "" validation of the debt '' & as of today 's date, they haven't provided me no validation of debt & continue to call me and 3rd parties. 

In closing, I am requesting that Jefferson Capital cease from calling me and any 3rd party. Furthermore, I will be filing a small claims lawsuit no later than XX/XX/2020, & today will be my only attempt to try and resolve this matter informally with Jefferson Capital before I file a lawsuit in small claims court. My lawsuit will be regarding the knowingly & willingly action ( s ) of Jefferson Capital violating my rights granted to me by the FDCRA & FCC. My lawsuit will be for {$2000.00} & the only communication I authorize Jefferson Capital to have with me is in writing & informing me if they agree to settle this matter informally.

Mortgage,"Upon receipt of a timely requested appeal, Bank of America GRANTED a Making Homes Affordable Home Affordable Modification Program ( MHA HAMP ) as evidenced by the Appeal Report if XXXX XXXX, XXXX issued by the Bank of America Appeals Department. The home loan account and borrower were directed to a HAMP Trial Payment Plan ( TPP ). Obviously, this never happened. What did happen is as detailed below. 
The then assigned single point of contact/customer relations manager ( SPOC/CRM ) XXXX XXXX issued two MHA HAMP DENIAL letters. The first is dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, two days before the date the Appeals Department issued their determination, and the other dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX days after the Appeals Department issued their determination. These documents are not modification denials on appeal issued by the Appeal Department. The creation of modification or loss mitigation approval and denial letters are not under the purview, duties and responsibilities of the SPOC/CRM. The job of the SPOC is to provide the information collected from the various departments who originate, establish, control, maintain and determine data, documents and decisions related to the modification and loss mitigation processes. 
Bank of America has been paying the XXXX ( XXXX ) insurance for this property and account since XXXX. This year, Bank of America decided not to pay the XXXX portion of the property insurance and have refused to pay it after I made several written requests for the Bank to do so immediately. An authorization to pay the XXXX insurance out of the escrow account associated with this home loan account has been provided in XXXX, prior to the first payment, but after the last mortgage payment I made in XXXX XXXX. By paying the property taxes and all insurances, Bank of America has firmly established a clear and long-standing practice to do so and to continue to do so without interruption and timely. 
Furthermore ( and for informational purposes only ), I was notified the account is in active foreclosure. Since no MHA HAMP has been formalized or finalized after the date the MHA HAMP was granted on appeal, the modification process has not been completed and, therefore, pending. Duel Tracking is prohibited. Refer to Bank of America document of XXXX XXXX, XXXX that Bank of America provided to me twice.

Mortgage,"This is a follow-up complaint to an original complaint filed in XXXX and listed as case # XXXX. 

Upon submission of that complaint, U.S. Bank, the target of the complaint, replied back to the CFPB that the banks servicing agent, XXXX, was who the complaint should have been directed to, and after a phone from the CFPB to authorize the change to XXXX, I agreed with that new direction. 

However, I 've since received a letter ( attached ) from U.S. Bank that sheds new light on the ongoing fraud. 

In short, as part of that original complaint, U.S. Bank, as the successor trustee to XXXX XXXX XXXX, now admits that the Trust itself owns my Note and Mortgage, not the trustee, which is XXXX degrees contrary to the legal position that XXXX XXXX XXXX, and now by its role as successor trustee U.S. Bank took 11 years years ago to fraudulently file a Complaint in Foreclosure against my wife and I, and then to steadfastly defend the original lie through multiple court actions spanning more than a decade of legal disputes. 

It also contradicts the position that U.S. Bank 's own servicer recently stated in the attached letter. 

The core of the matter is that the original complaint that was filed by trustee XXXX Bank, which then was allegedly acquired by XXXX XXXX XXXX during the course of the litigation, stated in the court filings that it was the 'Owner and holder ' of the promissory Note involving my home loan, when we now know 11 years later that legal position was then and is now a complete and total fabrication in a fraudulent attempt to illegally foreclose on my house. 

While I admire U.S. Bank for finally admitting the ruse is up, the issue can not be swept under the rug, and the buck can not be passed to their servicer, XXXX 

Under the terms of the Consent Decree with the Comptroller of the Currency that that U.S. Bank signed in XXXX, the bank was required to take certain steps to ensure, among other stipulations, that under Article IV of the Decree, the bank must have : ( b ) processes to ensure that all factual assertions made in pleadings, declarations, affidavits, or other sworn statements filed by or on behalf of the Bank are accurate, complete, and reliable ; and that affidavits and declarations are based on personal knowledge or a review of the Bank 's books and records when the affidavit or declaration so states ; ( d ) processes to review and approve standardized affidavits and declarations for each jurisdiction in which the Bank files foreclosure actions to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and court procedures ; ( e ) processes to ensure that the Bank has properly documented ownership of the promissory note and mortgage ( or deed of trust ) under applicable state law, or is otherwise a proper party to the action ( as a result of agency or other similar status ) at all stages of foreclosure and bankruptcy litigation, including appropriate transfer and delivery of endorsed notes and assigned mortgages or deeds of trust at the formation of a residential mortgage-backed security, and lawful and verifiable endorsement and successive assignment of the note and mortgage or deed of trust to reflect all changes of ownership ; However, its now clear based on the attached letter from U.S. Bank that at the time it filed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX an 'Alias Praecipe ' for sale authorizing XXXX XXXX Sheriff to sell my home at a sheriff 's sale, that the bank knew or should have known that the ownership of the note and mortgage was not alignment with the original summary judgment in foreclosure ( see attached ), and the Affidavit was not made with personal knowledge ( attached ) since it named my wife on the Note even though she 's not, and as a result, should not have submitted the Praecipe to XXXX XXXX Court since that very act constitutes a breach of the Consent Decree, violates Federal law, and is prima facie evidence of fraud upon the court.",0,"['folowup', 'complaint', 'original', 'complaint', 'filed', 'xx', 'listed', 'case', 'xx', 'upon', 'submision', 'complaint', 'u', 'bank', 'target', 'complaint', 'replied', 'back', 'cfpb',

Mortgage,"The purpose of this letter is to formally notify Carrington Mortgage Services ( CMS ) that the hazard insurance premium payment was incorrectly calculated at the time of determining my qualifying modified total ( PITI ) mortgage payment. This results in me actually having to pay {$200.00} more than the determined qualifying payment amount. CMS has the annual insurance premium amount incorrect on their documents. CMS incorrectly calculated an annual hazard insurance premium based on half of the actual premium amount ( {$1400.00} ) when the total annual premium is actually {$3400.00}. CMS used the 1/2 premium mid year amount and divided by 12 months, versus the actual annual premium amount. CMS determined my total PITI modified payment to be {$1700.00} based on this incorrect figure. Using the correct insurance payment of {$290.00}, as identified in the insurance billing and the modification request package, would result in a lower P & I payment to be equivalent to the {$1700.00} PITI payment. I am requesting the P & I payment be reduced to reflect the correct PITI amount of {$1700.00} as agreed, with the correct hazard insurance payment amount.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I am XXXX years old and live in an assisted living facility. I have been a Chase credit card holder for at least 20 years. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, while on the way to church, I told my daughter that one of my credit cards was missing. I always keep them in the same place in my wallet, and my Chase Marriott card was missing. Several days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, after searching for and not finding my card, I called Chase to cancel it, and was told there was a balance of {$860.00} on my account. I told them I had not been using that card and they told me the charges were made on XX/XX/XXXX at two local grocery stores in the amount of {$730.00}, and {$130.00}. I immediately told them the charges were fraudulent and they cancelled that card and sent me a replacement card ending in XXXX. My assisted living then contacted the police and I filed a police theft report on XX/XX/XXXX. It is assumed that one of the assisted living staff members stole the card out of my purse and utilized it twice on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since that time, I have been communicating with Chase at least monthly, yet they have denied my fraud claim multiple times and have even drastically lowered my available credit on my Chase United Card from {$25000.00} down to {$1400.00} due to non-payment and delinquency of the Marriot card. Chase continues to add late fees and interest to the account and after 11 months of communicating with Chase, the current balance is now at {$980.00}. 

This is a list of the dates that I have documented calls to Chase regarding these charges : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX Additionally, I mailed the police report to Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX DE XXXX. Chase fraud states they never got the report. 
I also had a local Chase Branch fax the police report to Chase Fraud Dept on XX/XX/XXXX using fax # XXXX XXXX XXXX. Today Chase Fraud stated they never got the report. 
Today, after finding out that the Fraud Dept STILL did not have my police report, the local Chase XXXX scanned and e-mailed it once more to the Fraud Dept. 
This accounts for at least 14 calls, one direct mailing, one fax and one scan and still my Fraud Case is  being denied. I am a throat XXXX survivor and each time I call Chase agents can not hear or understand me, and I need to repeat the same information over and over again. 

What concerns me most is that Chase failed to follow the Federal Fair Credit Billing Act has ruined my credit. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase stating that my line of credit on my Chase United card was decreased from {$25000.00} to {$1400.00} due to delinquency on accounts. Subsequently, my  auto ship medications were denied due to unavailable credit and I could not use my credit card to purchase medical supplies I need daily. On XX/XX/XXXX I had to have my daughter assist me with a credit review with Chase which took over 1 hour on the phone. XXXX then raised my line of credit to {$4000.00}, which is barely enough to sustain my monthly needs. 

I need help to get this issue resolved quickly. It has been going on for almost a year.",3,"['xx', 'year', 'old', 'live', 'asisted', 'living', 'facility', 'ben', 'chase', 'credit', 'card', 'holder', 'least', 'year', 'saturday', 'xxxx', 'way', 'church', 'told', 'daughter', 'one', 'credit', 'card', 'mising', 'always', 'kep', 'place', 'walet', 'chase', 'mariot', 'card', 'mising', 'several', 'day', 'later', 'xxxx', 'searching', 'finding', 'card', 'caled', 'chase', 'cancel', 'told', 'balance', 'acount', 'told', 'ben', 'using', 'card', 'told', 'charge', 'made', 'xxxx', 'two', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'amount', 'imediately', 'told', 'charge', 'fraudulent', 'canceled', 'card', 'sent', 'replacement', 'card', 'ending', 'xx', 'asisted', 'living', 'contacted', 'police', 'filed', 'police', 'theft', 'report', 'xxxx', 'asumed', 'one', 'asisted', 'living', 'staf', 'member', 'stole', 'card', 'purse', 'utilized', 'twice', 'xxxx', 'since', 'time', 'ben', 'comunicating', 'chase', 'least', 'monthly', 'yet', 'denied', 'fraud', 'claim', 'multiple', 'time', 'even', 'drasticaly', 'lowered', 'available', 'credit', 'chase', 'united', 'card', 'due', 'nonpayment', 'delinquency', 'mariot', 'card', 'chase', 'continues', 'ad', 'late', 'fe', 'interest', 'acount', 'month', 'comunicating', 'chase', 'curent', 'balance', 'list', 'date', 'documented', 'cals', 'chase', 'regarding', 'charge', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'aditionaly', 'mailed', 'police', 'report', 'chase', 'xxxx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'de', 'xx', 'chase', 'fraud', 'state', 'never', 'got', 'report', 'also', 'local', 'chase', 'branch', 'fax', 'police', 'report', 'chase', 'fraud', 'dept', 'xxxx', 'using', 'fax', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'today', 'chase', 'fraud', 'stated', 'never', 'got', 'report', 'today', 'finding', 'fraud', 'dept', 'stil', 'police', 'report', 'local', 'chase', 'xx', 'scaned', 'emailed', 'fraud', 'dept', 'acounts', 'least', 'cals', 'one', 'direct', 'mailing', 'one', 'fax', 'one', 'scan', 'stil', 'fraud', 'case', 'denied', 'throat', 'xx', 'survivor', 'time', 'cal', 'chase', 'agent', 'hear', 'understand', 'ned', 'repeat', 'information', 'concern', 'chase', 'failed', 'folow', 'federal', 'fair', 'credit', 'biling', 'act', 'ruined', 'credit', 'xxxx', 'received', 'leter', 'chase', 'stating', 'line', 'credit', 'chase', 'united', 'card', 'decreased', 'due', 'delinquency', 'acounts', 'subsequently', 'auto', 'ship', 'medication', 'denied', 'due', 'unavailable', 'credit', 'could', 'use', 'credit', 'card', 'purchase', 'medical', 'suplies', 'ned', 'daily', 'xxxx', 'daughter', 'asist', 'credit', 'review', 'chase', 'tok', 'hour', 'phone', 'xx', 'raised', 'line', 'credit', 'barely', 'enough', 'sustain', 'monthly', 'neds', 'ned', 'help', 'get', 'isue', 'resolved', 'quickly', 'ben', 'going', 'almost', 'year']",xx year old live asisted living facility ben chase credit card holder least year saturday xxxx way church told daughter one credit card mising always kep place walet chase mariot card mising several day later xxxx searching finding card caled chase cancel told balance acount told ben using card told charge made xxxx two local grocery store amount imediately told charge fraudulent canceled card sent replacement card ending xx asisted living contacted police filed police theft report xxxx asumed one asisted living staf member stole card purse utilized twice xxxx since time ben comunicating chase least monthly yet denied fraud claim multiple time even drasticaly lowered available credit chase united card due nonpayment delinquency mariot card chase continues ad late fe interest acount month comunicating chase curent balance list date documented cals chase regarding charge xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx aditionaly mailed police report chase xxxx xx xx xx xx de xx chase fraud state never got report also local chase branch fax police report chase fraud dept xxxx using fax xx xx xx today chase fraud stated never got report today finding fraud dept stil police report local chase xx scaned emailed fraud dept acounts least cals one direct mailing one fax one scan stil fraud case denied throat xx survivor time cal chase agent hear understand ned repeat information concern chase failed folow federal fair credit biling act ruined credit xxxx received leter chase stating line credit chase united card decreased due delinquency acounts subsequently auto ship medication denied due unavailable credit could use credit card purchase medical suplies ned daily xxxx daughter asist credit review chase tok hour phone xx raised line credit barely enough sustain monthly neds ned help get isue resolved quickly ben going almost year
Mortgage,"On  XX/XX/XXXX , Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has closed the investigation/complaint I had submitted against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. The complaint was submitted online, under my old email address which I can no longer access :  XXXX . ( this complaint will use my new email address :   XXXX   ). The CFPB Complaint 's Reference number is   XXXX  .
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing started billing me a monthly mortgage statement for a property in the address   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX , MA  XXXX  This address is for the entire condominium building. A current investigation with County Justice of the Superior Court in Massachusetts is on file under Docket  XXXX  ( on pleading for Leave of Court from  XXXX  Housing Court ). The Complaint is for the investigation that the Board of Trustees of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   Homeowners Association Trust were holding my mortgage 's security certificate for   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   between  XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX  when I was no longer required to pay for any mortgage by my servicer,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , presumably because that was what   XXXX   XXXX   give as benefit to the owners of the first-lien mortgage included in it. Within that time, a record in the  XXXX  County Registry of Deeds indicate there was a Partial Release on a mortgage under   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ( see   XXXX    County Doc  XXXX  on  XXXX , under Book/Page 46480/72 recorded o XX/XX/XXXX but the mortgage goes back to  XX/XX/XXXX ). This address does not exist since the Master Deed for the new condo was recorded back in  XX/XX/XXXX . However, this address,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   as well as   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   has been confused ( or deliberately falsely represented ) in several Land Court records to be under my name and under my first-lien mortgage 's security interest for the   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing has sworn under oath, of your authority, for the judicial order which conveys both my actual unit deed ( Book  XXXX  ) and my actual mortgage ( Book  XXXX  ) as well as the deeds either from the easement, appurtenance, or covenant, or all for the building with the address   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , Unfortunately, my mortgage with my Title and Declaration of Homestead had been conveyed as well. THESE ARE BOTH MAJOR FEDERAL AND MASSACHUSETTS VIOLATION, IN FACT A CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION OF MY HOMESTEAD RIGHTS. The unit deed and the fake addresses ' deeds had been distributed to each of the four Board of Trustees as well as the Condominium Trust. The Condominium Trust, under the address   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ( just like what your account references ) is now held by   XXXX   XXXX  , the appointed HOA Trustee residing on Unit 5. The link to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is undeniable -- the HOA Trust 's account and the Actual Balance of your billing statement on my name are both  XXXX  by XX/XX/XXXX . There is also a recast stated in your most recent statement under my name with the Loan Number  XXXX  and that it will start in XX/XX/XXXX . There is also a Distribution that will happen for the Class 1 and Class 2 tranches of   XXXX   XXXX   per its Prospectus filed with the SEC on  XX/XX/XXXX , which I have a General Trust Petition filed against the HOA Trust and for the   XXXX   XXXX   Trust to heed by judicial order. This record will definitely be distributed among the parties concerned, including Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing.
Your response has a clear and significant legal consequence. Please do not respond to this complaint that my name and the account number you have on file matches. That is not enough and it will be an attempt at aiding and abetting.

Student loan,"Before XX/XX/2018, I have paid additional {$200.00} payment to my account. The way they handled the over payment was applying the money toward the fee and interest first, whatever leftover applied principle of the loan, instead of apply whole {$200.00} toward principle. It is not like other loans that allow us to pay additional amount toward principle, which make me uncomfortable about it and feel unfair. It does not help me to pay off the loan faster. Also, they already charge us interest and fee, why the over payment still goes toward fee and interest first? And they don't the option that we could direct the over payment directly to principle without applying to fee and interest.",8,"['xx', 'paid', 'aditional', 'payment', 'acount', 'way', 'handled', 'payment', 'aplying', 'money', 'toward', 'fe', 'interest', 'first', 'whatever', 'leftover', 'aplied', 'principle', 'loan', 'instead', 'aply', 'whole', 'toward', 'principle', 'like', 'loan', 'alow', 'u', 'pay', 'aditional', 'amount', 'toward', 'principle', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'fel', 'unfair', 'help', 'pay', 'loan', 'faster', 'also', 'already', 'charge', 'u', 'interest', 'fe', 'payment', 'stil', 'go', 'toward', 'fe', 'interest', 'first', 'option', 'could', 'direct', 'payment', 'directly', 'principle', 'without', 'aplying', 'fe', 'interest']",xx paid aditional payment acount way handled payment aplying money toward fe interest first whatever leftover aplied principle loan instead aply whole toward principle like loan alow u pay aditional amount toward principle make uncomfortable fel unfair help pay loan faster also already charge u interest fe payment stil go toward fe interest first option could direct payment directly principle without aplying fe interest
Bank account or service,"XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to check my account balance with CHASE Bank on my mobile device and was unable to do so. I contacted the bank by phone in an effort to resolve the issue. I was informed that my account had been forcefully closed ( without my consent ), that my funds would be temporarily seized ( unable to be withdrawn in person ), and that nothing could be said other than that it had been determined that my account posed a threat to the bank, and was shut down ( I had not received any notice prior to this moment - by email, mail/post, or voice mail - that my account was being suspected of fraudulent activity, or was at risk of being closed on negative terms by J.P. Morgan CHASE bank. ) I was told that after a period of time, where all my transactions had essentially flat-lined, I would receive a check for my balance in the mail. This was my sole account and therefore had the entirety of my personal funds tied up in it. I did not use the debit card associated with my account from then on, exceeding the time period I was given over the phone for no transactions, in an attempt to receive the money I desperately needed as soon as possible. However, during this period, the educational institution I was a student at during the time was able to directly-deposit an amount for scholarship into my CHASE account that was supposedly "" closed. '' I again made an effort to resolve the issue, and after talking to multiple people was finally able to go and collect my scholarship money, and the remainder of my account 's balance, from a nearby CHASE branch in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I had no desire to inquire as to the bank 's decision in closing my account as I had already made many attempts to do so with no definitive answers ( nobody once verbalized in our conversations any "" suspicion of fraudulent activity '' ) and I had been subjected to minor grievances prior with the institution. Later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to open an account with a local credit union. The credit union denied my application because of a credit report they received from Chexsystems in which there was stated : "" Suspected Fraud Activity - J.P. Morgan Chase. '' Immediately following this, my brother and I drove to a local branch and talked with an assistant manager. This individual, like everyone else I had talked with prior ( via phone and in person ) could not tell me anything regarding the nature of my account 's closure, nor the "" suspected fraud activity '' note that had prevented me from becoming a member at another financial institution. Although this individual did get back to me, no questions were answered, and the issue was not resolved in any way. Next, I attempted to called corporate but after two hours of explaining the same story repeatedly, and being put on hold for extensive periods of time, I finally spoke with an individual who told me that I would not be resolving the issue in the manner I wished. As I 'd expressed clearly throughout the entirety of my 120-minute phone call with J.P. Morgan CHASE Bank, my only goal was to attempt to strike this from the record as 1 ) I was essentially being wrongfully accused of fraud activity - I had not knowingly committed any, and 2 ) I was not notified in any way that my account was at risk for any reason whatsoever. I left the issue there, having been preoccupied with a cross-country move for a position I had been hired on for at XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. However, the problem was still of much concern to me, as I was gravely worried that during my FBI background investigation, this would pose a serious threat to my employment ( in the area of credit ). Later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was again denied an account at a local credit union for this same reason that I was denied previously back in XXXX. This issue has, is, and will continue to create financial distress for me until resolved.",9,"['xxxx', 'atempted', 'check', 'acount', 'balance', 'chase', 'bank', 'mobile', 'device', 'unable',

Mortgage,"I have a pennymac home loan. I lost my job in XXXX and was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX in late XXXX to early XXXX. I have made calls to the loan service department and the escalation departments of pennymac ; in excess of 40 calls to try and save my home from foreclosure. 

Despite my request for loan modification process XXXX 2019, calls on my behalf by the veteran affair mortgage assistance beginning in XXXX to current. I was denied the modification in XXXX  2019.  The veterans affair representative advised me to petion for the VA foregiveness program offered to all veteran home loans. The forgiveness program was denied by Pennymac, even at the request of the VA loan representative. Payments made to Pennymac in the amount of {$580.00} were not applied to my loan but were being  held in a suspense account. 

Pennymac was still unwiling to work with me after the denied loan modification and the VA loan forgiveness program. 

With no recourse I was forced to list of my home for sale on XX/XX/19. Pennymac refused to halt forclosure proceedings even though my house was up for sale. 

After borrowing money for various relatives I was able to wire {$4800.00} on XX/XX/19 as requested by pennymac letter date XX/XX/2019. Pennymac has continuously refused to halt the foreclosure processing even though my loan is now current. Instead they have charged an additional {$4000.00} for legal processing fees. Unless someone intercedes on my behalf I fear the loss of my home. 

I am seeking help with this complaint.",0,"['penymac', 'home', 'loan', 'lost', 'job', 'xx', 'diagnosed', 'xx', 'xx', 'late', 'xx', 'early', 'xx', 'made', 'cals', 'loan', 'service', 'department', 'escalation', 'department', 'penymac', 'exces', 'cals', 'try', 'save', 'home', 'foreclosure', 'despite', 'request', 'loan', 'modification', 'proces', 'xx', 'cals', 'behalf', 'veteran', 'afair', 'mortgage', 'asistance', 'begining', 'xx', 'curent', 'denied', 'modification', 'xx', 'veteran', 'afair', 'representative', 'advised', 'petion', 'va', 'foregivenes', 'program', 'ofered', 'al', 'veteran', 'home', 'loan', 'forgivenes', 'program', 'denied', 'penymac', 'even', 'request', 'va', 'loan', 'representative', 'payment', 'made', 'penymac', 'amount', 'aplied', 'loan', 'held', 'suspense', 'acount', 'penymac', 'stil', 'unwiling', 'work', 'denied', 'loan', 'modification', 'va', 'loan', 'forgivenes', 'program', 'recourse', 'forced', 'list', 'home', 'sale', 'xx', 'penymac', 'refused', 'halt', 'forclosure', 'procedings', 'even', 'though', 'house', 'sale', 'borowing', 'money', 'various', 'relative', 'able', 'wire', 'xx', 'requested', 'penymac', 'leter', 'date', 'xx', 'penymac', 'continuously', 'refused', 'halt', 'foreclosure', 'procesing', 'even', 'though', 'loan', 'curent', 'instead', 'charged', 'aditional', 'legal', 'procesing', 'fe', 'unles', 'someone', 'intercedes', 'behalf', 'fear', 'los', 'home', 'seking', 'help', 'complaint']",penymac home loan lost job xx diagnosed xx xx late xx early xx made cals loan service department escalation department penymac exces cals try save home foreclosure despite request loan modification proces xx cals behalf veteran afair mortgage asistance begining xx curent denied modification xx veteran afair representative advised petion va foregivenes program ofered al veteran home loan forgivenes program denied penymac even request va loan representative payment made penymac amount aplied loan held suspense acount penymac stil unwiling work denied loan modification va loan forgivenes program recourse forced list home sale xx penymac refused halt forclosure procedings even though house sale borowing money various relative able wire xx requested penymac leter date xx penymac continuously refused halt foreclosure procesing even though loan curent instead charged aditional legal procesing fe unles someone intercedes behalf fear los home seking help complaint
Debt collection,"I never received a thing but a summons from Midland Funding , LLC ( Encore Capital ). I was never able to dispute anything. I answered the summons with my election for contractual arbitration and even sent Midland Funding a letter before I sumitted my answer to the court here in Arizona. 

Midland answered back with a motion for summary judgment. Midland ignored my letter electing arbitration per XXXX cardholder 's agreement. Midland forced me into litigation when a clause in XXXX 's cardholder agreement protects any alleged consumer from litigation. 

MY QUESTION TO MIDLAND FUNDING IS THIS : Why did you drag me into litigation when I invoked arbitration from day one? You ignored me. You denied my due process. 

CURRENT SITUATION : I was unlucky enough to get a superior court judge that does n't know arbitration laws and he gave Midland a summary judgment against me. I fought the litigation as much as possible, but the irony is that the arbitration clause protected me from litigation and yet Midland kept dragging me through it. 

Now there is a summary judgment that I am appealing to the Court of Appeals, who I hope knows the arbitration laws.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","We have been customers with Freedom Mortgage for 4.5 years -  XX/XX/2014 during that time we have never made a late payment on account number XXXX. That is until this year dated in XX/XX/XXXX. 

If you review my file history you will see I did in fact make payments on time for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The payment had gone up XXXX dollars in XX/XX/XXXX without my prior knowledge. Freedom mortgage took the payment that I have been accustomed to paying via bank draft as it does every month. Same as XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received the first notification from freedom mortgage stating my account was past due, confused and unaware of why it would be past due I contacted freedom immediately. It was on XX/XX/XXXX that I was made aware that my account was {$90.00} short ( {$30.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$30.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$30.00} XX/XX/XXXX ) and had already been reported to the credit bureau. On XX/XX/XXXX I also learned that the amount debited from my bank account had been placed in a reserve account with Freedom. NOT including XX/XX/XXXX, which freedom accepted. 

I travel for work and am only home 3-4 days a month had no idea that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was going to be placed in a separate account. Same as my XX/XX/XXXX payment. When looking at my bank account the funds had been accepted just like XX/XX/XXXX. I never once received any sort of notifications of this. 

According to my bank account information and payment history I have always made my payments on time. My credit has lowered 100 points  based on this {$90.00} Freedom mortgage did not provide ANY communication to me about the reserve account, the shortage, reporting to the credit bureau or give me an opportunity to resolve the issue.

Debt collection,"I have been trying to resolve a collections account with NCC BUSINESS SERVICES since XXXX regarding move out/early termination charges for an apartment I shared with my ex boyfriend. Certainly we were aware there was going to be monetary consequences for breaking a lease, but in excess of {$6700.00} is unbelievable! I have disputed the charges ( EX : $ 1100+ fee for carpets where there were NO pets and we lived in the unit for less than 12 months ) and attempted to work out a settlement option for a reduced, reasonable, and affordable amount using our tax refund and every time I was told they do NOT do settlements and I can just pay what I can towards the balance until it is paid in full. 

Recently, I decided to dispute the account with the credit bureaus regarding these erroneous and inflated charges in efforts to resolve this and on TrXXXX it indicates the account is now closed ( which it never said this before ). So I contacted NCC BUSINESS SERVICES onXX/XX/XXXX to see the status of the account. I spoke with a representative by the name of XXXX and asked him if this was open and if they were still collecting on it and he said "" yes ''. I explained to him what was mentioned above and he then informed me he would submit for a "" debt reduction '' and he would call back once he spoke with management on an answer. I asked why he would be able to submit for a "" debt reduction '' now when all these years I was told they did n't do settlements/reduce balances and that I needed to just make payments towards the balance. He told me because "" I did n't qualify ''. So I then asked how NCC BUSINESS SERVICES would know if I qualified or not because nobody every asked me any questions regarding my circumstance to determine if I did or did n't qualify? He said because we were n't on unemployment, on SSI, disability etc. Which is actually inaccurate because for XXXX XXXX ( my ex who was also on the lease with me ) was unemployed during a portion of the time we lived in this apartment. However, I was still employed while all this took place and even asked ( during a previous call ) to do a single party settlement to remove my name only and pursue XXXX for the remainder and was denied this workout option as well.

Chase had issued a Court Ordered "" Hold '' on my account for {$12000.00}. They also mistakenly "" debited '' {$12000.00} out of my checking account. They agreed the total amount was {$12000.00} and that they mistakenly tied up {$24000.00} causing the stop payment for insufficient funds. 

The Brokerage now has fined me for failing to settle the transaction, not to mention {$1600.00} in lost gains and they closed my account. 

I spent hours on the phone with various Chase customer service representatives and Court Order and Levies representatives. They admitted to the problem and said they would reissue the payment for the securities within 24 hours.

I am maintaining a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Attorney Generals office, should you continue in your non-compliance of federal laws under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the corresponding local state laws. I further remind you that you may be liable for your willful non-compliance. 

Failure on your behalf to provide a copy of any alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature may result in a small claims action against your company. 

I would be seeking a minimum of XXXX} in damages per violation for : Defamation Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( including but not limited to Section 807-8 ) Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( including but not limited to Section 623-b ) Attempt # 3 dated XXXX XXXX with a Cease and Desist phone call notice To Whom It May Concern : This letter is being sent to you as a Dispute to the letters I received from you dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, in the amount of $ $ $ $ $ $ XXXX 
Be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809. The purpose of this document is to notify you that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. 

I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you/XXXX. Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for. 
Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe. 
Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay you/XXXX what you say I owe. 
Please attach a copy of any signed agreement debtor has made or other verifiable proof that debtor has a contractual obligation to pay XXXX. 
Please attach a copy of any agreement that bears the signature of the debtor, wherein he/she agreed to pay XXXX. 

In the absence of any such documentation bearing my signature, I formally request that this information is immediately deleted from the credit file filed under my Social Security number xxxxxxxxx. I do not consent to any means of automated verification. 

Now, I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX TransUnion ) this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company, I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following : Defamation Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( including but not limited to Section 807-8 ) Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( including but not limited to Section 623-b ) Pursuant to my rights  under federal debt collection laws, I am requesting that you cease and desist calls to xxx-xxx-xxxx and xxx-xxx-xxxx in relation to the alleged account. 
You are hereby notified that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and the Georgia Attorney Generals office. Civil and criminal claims will be pursued. 
If your office provides validation with proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must CEASE AND DESIST. 

Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalid. 

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. Do not call my relatives or my friends. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls, or calls to third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. 

All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter through the XXXX. 

It would be advisable that you assure that your records are in order. This is an attempt to correct your records. Any information obtained may be used for that purpose. 

Since I have been unsuccessful in getting any results from XXXX I 've decided to seek additional assistance in this matter.",1,"['student', 'loan', 'transfered', 'xx', 'company', 'next', 'next',

Mortgage,"We have applied for loan modification 3 times. 
First, we applied in XXXX with a valid hardship. We submitted all documentation to verify all non-borrower contributors. However, Wells Fargo only utilized one income ( the borrowers ). When questioned, Wells initially said they DID utilize all non-borrower contributors ( which would have been 3 additional incomes, PLUS the borrowers income ). When pressed for documentation, they then said they did not use all the non-borrower contributions because they believed the borrower did not live in the household. He did live in the household. They never asked for any documentation NOR did they state that was the reason for denial until the following year. 

The second time we tried for loan modification in XXXX, we were denied for almost everything due to a chapter XXXX bankruptcy we had to file to save our home. We were approved for a short sale. We appealed this, because we received a promotion at work with higher pay AND because the bankruptcy was dismissed. In their calculations, they also used two different incomes. I asked why, and they did not respond. They stated we did not make enough money to support a repayment plan. I asked the NPR calculation used and which income they used. They did not respond. They denied our appeal and said we would need to resubmit an entire loan modification packet to be reviewed without the bankruptcy. 

Right after the denial of the appeal, they set a foreclosure sale date. 

We asked for a short sale approval since we were previously approved for one, they said no. 

I am reapplying for loan modification but each time I submit a piece of verification paperwork they ask for more things. This means they are going to keep denying it until they take my home. 

I can not get ahold of anyone that has answers, nor get a call back, unless I file a complaint with CFPB.",0,"['aplied', 'loan', 'modification', 'time', 'first', 'aplied', 'xx', 'valid', 'hardship', 'submited', 'al', 'documentation', 'verify', 'al', 'nonborower', 'contributor', 'however', 'wels', 'fargo', 'utilized', 'one', 'income', 'borowers', 'questioned', 'wels', 'initialy', 'said', 'utilize', 'al', 'nonborower', 'contributor', 'would', 'ben', 'aditional', 'income', 'plus', 'borowers', 'income', 'presed', 'documentation', 'said', 'use', 'al', 'nonborower', 'contribution', 'believed', 'borower', 'live', 'household', 'live', 'household', 'never', 'asked', 'documentation', 'state', 'reason', 'denial', 'folowing', 'year', 'second', 'time', 'tried', 'loan', 'modification', 'xx', 'denied', 'almost', 'everything', 'due', 'chapter', 'xx', 'bankruptcy', 'file', 'save', 'home', 'aproved', 'short', 'sale', 'apealed', 'received', 'promotion', 'work', 'higher', 'pay', 'bankruptcy', 'dismised', 'calculation', 'also', 'used', 'two', 'diferent', 'income', 'asked', 'respond', 'stated', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'suport', 'repayment', 'plan', 'asked', 'npr', 'calculation', 'used', 'income', 'used', 'respond', 'denied', 'apeal', 'said', 'would', 'ned', 'resubmit', 'entire', 'loan', 'modification', 'packet', 'reviewed', 'without', 'bankruptcy', 'right', 'denial', 'apeal', 'set', 'foreclosure', 'sale', 'date', 'asked', 'short', 'sale', 'aproval', 'since', 'previously', 'aproved', 'one', 'said', 'reaplying', 'loan', 'modification', 'time', 'submit', 'piece', 'verification', 'paperwork', 'ask', 'thing', 'mean', 'going', 'kep', 'denying', 'take', 'home', 'get', 'ahold', 'anyone', 'answer', 'get', 'cal', 'back', 'unles', 'file', 'complaint', 'cfpb']",aplied loan modification time first aplied xx valid hardship submited al documentation verify al nonborower contributor however wels fargo utilized one income borowers questioned wels initialy said utilize al nonborower contributor would ben aditional income plus borowers income presed documentation said use al nonborower contribution believed borower live household live household never asked documentation state reason denial folowing year second time tried loan modification xx denied almost everything due chapter xx bankruptcy file save home aproved short sale apealed received promotion work higher pay bankruptcy dismised calculation also used two diferent income asked respond stated make enough money suport repayment plan asked npr calculation used income used respond denied apeal said would ned resubmit entire loan modification packet reviewed without bankruptcy right denial apeal set foreclosure sale date asked short sale aproval since previously aproved one said reaplying loan modification time submit piece verification paperwork ask thing mean going kep denying take home get ahold anyone answer get cal back unles file complaint cfpb

Debt collection,"I have been a victim of Identity Theft and was reported back in  XXXX   XXXX  I have been in the  XXXX  since for the past 2 years and the IRS got a hold of me and told me I have been a victim of Identity theft,  they were the one that caught it. I have reported this to IRS, Social Security, Identytheft.gov . FTC,  XXXX  Credit Bureaus, the local sheriff department, and much more. It has been an ongoing thing ever since and evidently it has also screwed up not just my credit report but also my background. Now I have been trying to fix as much as I could on my Identit y, and one was with my credit. There is one company that has put me on collections and put me on derogatory mark on there. I have reached out to them several times trying to let them my situations. Th e company is called ABILITY RECOVERY SERVICE   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX   XXXX , PA  XXXX  Phone number : (  XXXX  )  XXXX , thats the collections agency and the original debt was towards a college, called  XXXX   XXXX . They said that the account was opened on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX . They did not provide any account number or anything.I have spoken to them numerous times I have explained my situation and all they have said was they can not remove my account out of the credit report and forcing me that this is my account. They told me to get a police report I hav e a sheriff department to make my report because in my area that is the jurisdiction on where I live and not police I did go to the police department and they told me to go to the sheriff office. Again they did n't tell where to submit my documents and also they have been so ride and make degrading remarks. They finally got fed up listening to me and they got mad they said I was yelling an d screaming hen all I was doing was explaining myself in a nice civil manner and they hung up the phone. Then when I call back they just dont pick up and forward me to a voicemail. I have been harass from these people put down an been degrade talked down too.

I called and stated if she should have never been on the loan she should be given back her money and the loan should be closed because of having a second loan open fraudulently.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have XXXX credit cards with Bank of America, and have a GOOD history of making my payments on time. This month, however, someone was late sending me a check, and the cards were A FEW DAYS past due. On Sunday, XX/XX/2017, I was away from home and stopped to buy gas. My credit card would n't work. Luckily it took my debit card. This was on a Sunday afternoon. I called my bank as soon as this happened, and was told that because I was A FEW DAYS LATE, they had turned off my credit cards WITHOUT WARNING. 

What would have happened if I had n't had my debit card with me? I was a good XXXX miles away from home. I WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT STRANDED, WITH NO WAY TO GET HOME. I WOULD HAVE HAD TO CAMP OUT IN MY CAR ALONG THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND BEEN LEFT AT THE MERCY OF PASSING MOTORISTS. I 'M XXXX YEARS OLD AND XXXX. I COULD N'T HAVE DEFENDED MYSELF IF SOMEONE HAD BROKEN INTO MY CAR WHILE I WAS IN IT. I COULD HAVE BEEN XXXX OR XXXX. 

If i had been 30 past due I would have understood this, but it was LESS THAN ONE WEEK. What if I 'd mailed a check but it had n't cleared yet? I would have STILL BEEN LEFT AT THE MERCY OF PASSING MOTORISTS. 

Why did n't Bank of America NOTIFY ME THAT THEY WERE DOING THIS? I had NO WARNING WHATSOEVER. 

I got my check, the credit card payments have been made, but I have changed banks.

Student loan,"I paid my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, which was late ; since my due date is the XXXX. I noticed my student loan monthly payment went up to {$200.00} when Nelnet emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX. Also I made 3 payments in XX/XX/XXXX to make my account current. I called Nelnet 2 days later on XX/XX/XXXX twice to find the reason why my monthly payment increased. I don't remember the first reps name, but she told me the reason why my payments went up, is because I'm on the graduated payment plan and I've already made 24 monthly payments. That is a blatant lie, since my loan transferred to Nelnet in XX/XX/XXXX and I paid {$190.00} that month, which was my monthly payment I had at XXXX XXXX before Nelnet took my loan over. Nelnet in a letter I received said it would be ok to pay that same amount for first month and then I would have to pick a payment plan. I picked the graduated plan and for the first 24 months I would pay {$160.00}. So, I called back after doing some research to find out how many payments I made. I actually only made 16 payments up til that point, so I should technically have 8 more months, now 7, to go before my payments go up. I called Nelnet back the same day and spoke to XXXX ; I explained the reason for my call and what the first rep said. After a couple minutes of XXXX reviewing my account, she said the reason my payment increased, was because interest had recalculated when I get off the auto debit program, which makes no sense either and I even stated that on the phone before the call ended. That answer isn't legit either. I was on the auto pay at the end of XX/XX/XXXX for a couple months and when I got off of the auto pay program my payments never went up, because of the interest recalculating. So, at that point I emailed Nelnet to see If I could get a correct answer, since obviously the reps that are working at Nelnet have no idea what they are doing and talking about. Nelnet emailed me back a few days later and said in the email to call them. I called Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX and the rep said that when my loan came over Nelnet ; Nelnet didn't have the right terms for the payments, so when Nelnet found out, the terms were corrected. I a lot of things are wrong with this : First off, the first 2 of the reps lied, which I'm pretty sure is a violation of the FDCPA. Second it shouldn't have taken 3 calls to get the correct answer. Third I shouldn't have to bite the bullet per se, because Nelnet couldn't do their job before they took complete ownership of my student loan in the first place. Lastly a flag should have been seen by Nelnets system between the {$190.00} payment and the {$160.00} payment. So, I applied for an income driven payment plan.",8,"['paid', 'xxxx', 'payment', 'xxxx', 'late', 'since', 'due', 'date', 'xx', 'noticed', 'student', 'loan', 'monthly', 'payment', 'went', 'nelnet', 'emailed', 'xxxx', 'also', 'made', 'payment', 'xxxx', 'make', 'acount', 'curent', 'caled', 'nelnet', 'day', 'later', 'xxxx', 'twice', 'find', 'reason', 'monthly', 'payment', 'increased', 'rember', 'first', 'rep', 'name', 'told', 'reason', 'payment', 'went', 'graduated', 'payment', 'plan', 'ive', 'already', 'made', 'monthly', 'payment', 'blatant', 'lie', 'since', 'loan', 'transfered', 'nelnet', 'xxxx', 'paid', 'month', 'monthly', 'payment', 'xx', 'xx', 'nelnet', 'tok', 'loan', 'nelnet', 'leter', 'received', 'said', 'would', 'ok', 'pay', 'amount', 'first', 'month', 'would', 'pick', 'payment', 'plan', 'picked', 'graduated', 'plan', 'first', 'month', 'would', 'pay', 'caled', 'back', 'research', 'find', 'many', 'payment', 'made', 'actualy', 'made', 'payment', 'til', 'point', 'technicaly', 'month', 'go', 'payment', 'go', 'caled', 'nelnet', 'back', 'day', 'spoke', 'xx', 'explained', 'reason', 'cal', 'first', 'rep', 'said', 'couple', 'minute', 'xx', 'reviewing', 'acount', 'said', 'reason', 'payment', 'increased', 'interest', 'recalculated', 'get', 'auto', 'debit', 'program', 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'even', 'stated', 'phone', 'cal', 'ended', 'answer', 'legit', 'either', 'auto', 'pay', 'end', 'xxxx', 'couple', 'month', 'got', 'auto', 'pay', 'program', 'payment', 'never', 'went', 'interest', 'recalculating', 'point', 'emailed', 'nelnet', 'se', 'could', 'get', 'corect', 'answer', 'since', 'obviously', 'rep', 'working', 'nelnet', 'idea', 'talking', 'nelnet', 'emailed', 'back', 'day', 'later', 'said', 'email', 'cal', 'caled', 'nelnet', 'xxxx', 'rep', 'said', 'loan', 'came', 'nelnet', 'nelnet', 'right', 'term', 'payment', 'nelnet', 'found', 'term', 'corected', 'lot', 'thing', 'wrong', 'first', 'first', 'rep', 'lied', 'prety', 'sure', 'violation', 'fdcpa', 'second', 'shouldnt', 'taken', 'cals', 'get', 'corect', 'answer', 'third', 'shouldnt', 'bite', 'bulet', 'per', 'se', 'nelnet', 'could', 'job', 'tok', 'complete', 'ownership', 'student', 'loan', 'first', 'place', 'lastly', 'flag', 'ben', 'sen', 'nelnets', 'system', 'betwen', 'payment', 'payment', 'aplied', 'income', 'driven', 'payment', 'plan']",paid xxxx payment xxxx late since due date xx noticed student loan monthly payment went nelnet emailed xxxx also made payment xxxx make acount curent caled nelnet day later xxxx twice find reason monthly payment increased rember first rep name told reason payment went graduated payment plan ive already made monthly payment blatant lie since loan transfered nelnet xxxx paid month monthly payment xx xx nelnet tok loan nelnet leter received said would ok pay amount first month would pick payment plan picked graduated plan first month would pay caled back research find many payment made actualy made payment til point technicaly month go payment go caled nelnet back day spoke xx explained reason cal first rep said couple minute xx reviewing acount said reason payment increased interest recalculated get auto debit program make sense either even stated phone cal ended answer legit either auto pay end xxxx couple month got auto pay program payment never went interest recalculating point emailed nelnet se could get corect answer since obviously rep working nelnet idea talking nelnet emailed back day later said email cal caled nelnet xxxx rep said loan came nelnet nelnet right term payment nelnet found term corected lot thing wrong first first rep lied prety sure violation fdcpa second shouldnt taken cals get corect answer third shouldnt bite bulet per se nelnet could job tok complete ownership student loan first place lastly flag ben sen nelnets system betwen payment payment aplied income driven payment plan

Portfolio Recovery Associates has reported delinquent information to the credit bureaus, I am demanding that this information be deleted from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I do not have a signed contract nor any contract with Portfolio Recovery Associates. I have never done Business with this company. I want this removed from all 3 credit bureaus files.

My notices were sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809b that I disputed their claim and requested validation.

My letters were not a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named, Title and Section. I respectfully requested that Portfolio Recovery Associate provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay them. 
I asked for and as required by law to provide me with the following : Agreement with your client that grants you the authority to collect on this alleged debt, or proof of acquisition by purchase or assignment. Agreement that bears the signature of the alleged debtor wherein he/she agreed to pay the creditor.

I never received a copy of a signed contract as required by law. This company in which I hold no contract with nor have received services. This business failed to provide adequate proof.

This Account, XXXX, is correctly identified on the credit report as opening XX/XX/XXXX.

Especially since JPMorgan Chase is WELL aware that every payment was made on time. 
I filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. This loan was not included in the bankruptcy. I signed and submitted a reaffirmation letter JPMorgan Chase, however they did not sign and return it in time for it to be filed with the bankruptcy. 
The month I filed is the month that JPMorgan Chase is reporting as the date of 1st Delinquency.

Vehicle loan or lease,I started calling to PNC Bank to obtain my pay off amount in XX/XX/XXXX9. My  payments were submitted by XXXX XXXX accelerated program and were always submitted on time. They deducted from my bank account every two weeks a set and consistently throughout the year Occasionally there would be an extra amount in which XXXX XXXX would submit to PNC as a principal payment and noted as such on the manual check and mailed to pnc for posting. PNC applied most payments correctly but I did find a few that were not applied correctly and interest deducted from those payments. I started my inquiry when I requested my payoff amount. I never received monthly ststements from PNC to show payment activity. When I looked over my history in XX/XX/XXXX I noticed some payments were not applied correctly. I called and requested PNC to review my loan starting from inception date in XX/XX/XXXX. PNC acknowledged error and corrected two of the payments in which this lowered my payoff amount. I called back to pnc to let them know there was still two payments to be corrected. I wanted tbe correct payoff amount before paying off my auto. PNC NEVER CALLED BACK. I was always the initiator for the status of inquiry. This started in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX still reviewing case open. In XX/XX/XXXX i called again to convey my frustration. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX there was a decision and they would not consider XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to be posted correctly and recalculate interest as they were too old. But they did reapply another XX/XX/XXXX principal only payment. This was clearly their error and did not post payments correctly therefore I overpaid on my loan. I did payoff loan in november so i did not accrue further daily interest. This loan was paid off approximately one year early with never a late payment. I just want to pay the correct payoff amount with the correct interest applied. If they do this to other people and their defense is that it is up to the consumer to track their payments but they do not hold themselves responsible as to have quality employees to apply payments correctly. They add re making money off this process. My final complaint was if they can not calculate back to those two payments then figure a fair amount that would be refunded to me. They closed complaint and stated they could not help me. This took 4 months to let me know they could not do anything about it. Then their employee that was working on my file lied about calling me back and stating phone number was not good or could not leave voicemail. I just want want is due back to me and to pay correct amount on my loan. I still do not have an official response in writing from PNC and never received verbal response without me initiating the call. Very poor customer service. What other options do I have to receive my refund?,5,"['started', 'caling', 'pnc', 'bank', 'obtain', 'pay', 'amount', 'xxxx', 'payment', 'submited', 'xx', 'xx', 'acelerated', 'program', 'always', 'submited', 'time', 'deducted', 'bank', 'acount', 'every', 'two', 'weks', 'set', 'consistently', 'throughout', 'year', 'ocasionaly', 'would', 'extra', 'amount', 'xx', 'xx', 'would', 'submit', 'pnc', 'principal', 'payment', 'noted', 'manual', 'check', 'mailed', 'pnc', 'posting', 'pnc', 'aplied', 'payment', 'corectly', 'find', 'aplied', 'corectly', 'interest', 'deducted', 'payment', 'started', 'inquiry', 'requested', 'payof', 'amount', 'never', 'received', 'monthly', 'stements', 'pnc', 'show', 'payment', 'activity', 'loked', 'history', 'xxxx', 'noticed', 'payment', 'aplied', 'corectly', 'caled', 'requested', 'pnc', 'review', 'loan', 'starting', 'inception', 'date', 'xxxx', 'pnc', 'acknowledged', 'eror', 'corected', 'two', 'payment', 'lowered', 'payof', 'amount', 'caled', 'back', 'pnc', 'let', 'know', 'stil', 'two', 'payment', 'corected', 'wanted', 'tbe', 'corect', 'payof', 'amount', 'paying', 'auto', 'pnc', 'never', 'caled', 'back', 'always', 'initiator', 'status', 'inquiry', 'started', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'stil', 'reviewing', 'case', 'open', 'xxxx', 'caled', 'convey', 'frustration', 'told', 'xxxx', 'decision', 'would', 'consider', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'posted', 'corectly', 'recalculate', 'interest', 'old', 'reaply', 'another', 'xxxx', 'principal', 'payment', 'clearly', 'eror', 'post', 'payment', 'corectly', 'therefore', 'overpaid', 'loan', 'payof', 'loan', 'november', 'acrue', 'daily', 'interest', 'loan', 'paid', 'aproximately', 'one', 'year', 'early', 'never', 'late', 'payment', 'want', 'pay', 'corect', 'payof', 'amount', 'corect', 'interest', 'aplied', 'people', 'defense', 'consumer', 'track', 'payment', 'hold', 'responsible', 'quality', 'employes', 'aply', 'payment', 'corectly', 'ad', 'making', 'money', 'proces', 'final', 'complaint', 'calculate', 'back', 'two', 'payment', 'figure', 'fair', 'amount', 'would', 'refunded', 'closed', 'complaint', 'stated', 'could', 'help', 'tok', 'month', 'let', 'know', 'could', 'anything', 'employe', 'working', 'file', 'lied', 'caling', 'back', 'stating', 'phone', 'number', 'god', 'could', 'leave', 'voicemail', 'want', 'want', 'due', 'back', 'pay', 'corect', 'amount', 'loan', 'stil', 'oficial', 'response', 'writing', 'pnc', 'never', 'received', 'verbal', 'response', 'without', 'initiating', 'cal', 'por', 'customer', 'service', 'option', 'receive', 'refund']",started caling pnc bank obtain pay amount xxxx payment submited xx xx acelerated program always submited time deducted bank acount every two weks set consistently throughout year ocasionaly would extra amount xx xx would submit pnc principal payment noted manual check mailed pnc posting pnc aplied payment corectly find aplied corectly interest deducted payment started inquiry requested payof amount never received monthly stements pnc show payment activity loked history xxxx noticed payment aplied corectly caled requested pnc review loan starting inception date xxxx pnc acknowledged eror corected two payment lowered payof amount caled back pnc let know stil two payment corected wanted tbe corect payof amount paying auto pnc never caled back always initiator status inquiry started xxxx xxxx stil reviewing case open xxxx caled convey frustration told xxxx decision would consider xxxx xxxx posted corectly recalculate interest old reaply another xxxx principal payment clearly eror post payment corectly therefore overpaid loan payof loan november acrue daily interest loan paid aproximately one year early never late payment want pay corect payof amount corect interest aplied people defense consumer track payment hold responsible quality employes aply payment corectly ad making money proces final complaint calculate back two payment figure fair amount would refunded closed complaint stated could help tok month let know could anything employe working file lied caling back stating phone number god could leave voicemail want want due back pay corect amount loan stil oficial response writing pnc never received verbal response without initiating cal por customer service option receive refund

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/2015 I hired a contractor to perform a very small ( 3-4 hour ) job at one of my rental homes. I met the workers in the late morning and let them in the home. Several days later, I contacted the contractor to arrange payment and was told that they were finishing up the work at that very moment. I told them that was impossible because my job only supposed to take one afternoon. I was told that additional work beyond what I had requested was performed. I told them that no additional work was requested or approved. I was told that the company owner would contact me to discuss. In spite of calling him several times and leaving messages, to date, I have never heard directly from him. Eventually, I received a bill for approximately {$2500.00} more than the job should've cost based on information gathered from other contractors. Upon reviewing the documents included in the bill, I discovered that the contractor claimed to have performed much more work than they were hired to do. They justified all of this extra work by presenting work orders signed by my tenant. I asked my tenant about this and he said that the contractor told him that I had requested this work and that it was ok for him to sign for me. Of course, this was not true. In fact, I never signed anything related to this job whatsoever. The contractor 's documents even attempt to assert that the job was related to an insurance claim with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have never insured this property with XXXX XXXX and the original job I requested was in no way related to any insurance claim. I sent a check to the contractor in the amount that his competitors indicated they would've charged. The contractor refused to accept my check as payment and eventually turned me over to collections. Upon hearing from the collection agency, I referred them to my attorney and have heard nothing more from them. In XX/XX/2015 this collection showed up on my credit report. I contacted Equifax and disputed it. I provided all of the various documentation clearly showing the signature of my tenant on the work orders. I explained the entire situation and that obviously, my tenants are never authorized to obligate me to pay for work performed by contractors. Equifax responded by allowing the collection to show up on my credit report in spite of clear and overwhelming evidence of fraud committed by the contractor. It seems clear to me that Equifax is catering to the entities that pay them rather than the ordinary consumer that is harmed by them.",1,"['xx', 'hired', 'contractor', 'perform', 'smal', 'hour', 'job', 'one', 'rental', 'home', 'met', 'worker', 'late', 'morning', 'let', 'home', 'several', 'day', 'later', 'contacted', 'contractor', 'arange', 'payment', 'told', 'finishing', 'work', 'moment', 'told', 'imposible', 'job', 'suposed', 'take', 'one', 'afternon', 'told', 'aditional', 'work', 'beyond', 'requested', 'performed', 'told', 'aditional', 'work', 'requested', 'aproved', 'told', 'company', 'owner', 'would', 'contact', 'discus', 'spite', 'caling', 'several', 'time', 'leaving', 'mesages', 'date', 'never', 'heard', 'directly', 'eventualy', 'received', 'bil', 'aproximately', 'job', 'shouldve', 'cost', 'based', 'information', 'gathered', 'contractor', 'upon', 'reviewing', 'document', 'included', 'bil', 'discovered', 'contractor', 'claimed', 'performed', 'much', 'work', 'hired', 'justified', 'al', 'extra', 'work', 'presenting', 'work', 'order', 'signed', 'tenant', 'asked', 'tenant', 'said', 'contractor', 'told', 'requested', 'work', 'ok', 'sign', 'course', 'true', 'fact', 'never', 'signed', 'anything', 'related', 'job', 'whatsoever', 'contractor', 'document', 'even', 'atempt', 'asert', 'job', 'related', 'insurance', 'claim', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'never', 'insured', 'property', 'xx', 'xx', 'original', 'job', 'requested', 'way', 'related', 'insurance', 'claim', 'sent', 'check', 'contractor', 'amount', 'competitor', 'indicated', 'wouldve', 'charged', 'contractor', 'refused', 'acept', 'check', 'payment', 'eventualy', 'turned', 'colections', 'upon', 'hearing', 'colection', 'agency', 'refered', 'atorney', 'heard', 'nothing', 'xx', 'colection', 'showed', 'credit', 'report', 'contacted', 'equifax', 'disputed', 'provided', 'al', 'various', 'documentation', 'clearly', 'showing', 'signature', 'tenant', 'work', 'order', 'explained', 'entire', 'situation', 'obviously', 'tenant', 'never', 'authorized', 'obligate', 'pay', 'work', 'performed', 'contractor', 'equifax', 'responded', 'alowing', 'colection', 'show', 'credit', 'report', 'spite', 'clear', 'overwhelming', 'evidence', 'fraud', 'comited', 'contractor', 'sems', 'clear', 'equifax', 'catering', 'enties', 'pay', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'consumer', 'harmed']",xx hired contractor perform smal hour job one rental home met worker late morning let home several day later contacted contractor arange payment told finishing work moment told imposible job suposed take one afternon told aditional work beyond requested performed told aditional work requested aproved told company owner would contact discus spite caling several time leaving mesages date never heard directly eventualy received bil aproximately job shouldve cost based information gathered contractor upon reviewing document included bil discovered contractor claimed performed much work hired justified al extra work presenting work order signed tenant asked tenant said contractor told requested work ok sign course true fact never signed anything related job whatsoever contractor document even atempt asert job related insurance claim xx xx xx xx never insured property xx xx original job requested way related insurance claim sent check contractor amount competitor indicated wouldve charged contractor refused acept check payment eventualy turned colections upon hearing colection agency refered atorney heard nothing xx colection showed credit report contacted equifax disputed provided al various documentation clearly showing signature tenant work order explained entire situation obviously tenant never authorized obligate pay work performed contractor equifax responded alowing colection show credit report spite clear overwhelming evidence fraud comited contractor sems clear equifax catering enties pay rather ordinary consumer harmed
Consumer Loan,"I have attached the full complaint. 
I have been financing a 2016 KIA Soul through Kia Finance for 1 year now. I have made every single payment on time and have had no problems, until I tried shipping my vehicle overseas due to a military XXXX. I started this process with Kia Finance three weeks ago and it is still not solved. First off, my wife called the service desk number XXXX over 3 weeks ago. She asked about the process on how to ship a vehicle overseas and the response was that a "" Vehicle Transport Request Form '' was needed and that we should receive it in the mail between XXXX five business days. XXXX five business days go by and we received nothing, to this day we still have not received this from Kia Finance. After five business days, I call XXXX, a different customer support number. This customer support number "" apologizes for the inconvenience '' and lets me know that the form is available online for me to print out ... We fill out the form immediately and fax it to XXXX with all of the extra required forms. I call the customer support phone number XXXX the next day and they say "" unfortunately, they still have not received the documents, it can anywhere from XXXX five business days to receive the paperwork. '' I have never heard of a fax taking five business days to be received. I let 72 business hours go by and call back customer support and I get more or less the same answer "" unfortunately, they still have not received the documents, it can anywhere from XXXX five business days to receive the paperwork and I can try faxing it to a different number '' ( I do not remember the second fax number by it was confirmed multiple times by customer service that it was also a correct fax number. At this point it is getting closer and closer to my military move and I literally call customer service every day and get no help at all. All customer service has to say is that "" unfortunately, they have not received the documents and there is nothing they can do. '' Furiously, I ask for supervisors and managers, still calling every day. Some supervisors said that another office does this entire process and there are "" no phones '' in their building and no way to contact them. Another supervisor said he would email them and "" should get a response within 72 hours. '' 72 hours go by ... no response. At this point I am less than a week away from moving and need to make something happen, so I refinance. I am now going to have to pay over {$800.00} in finance charges that I would n't have had to pay with Kia Finance, but it would all be worth it, because XXXX was able to give me a letter authorizing me to ship my vehicle overseas ( I got the loan approval and the letter of approval in less than 15 minutes on the phone with a XXXX employee ), even before they receive the title from Kia. I priority shipped the check on a Friday and figured I would be able to ship my vehicle overseas on Monday no problem. Well, I was wrong again. Since my registration stated that Kia Finance had my title, the shipping company needed something from Kia Finance stating that my loan was either paid in full or a letter authorizing me to ship the vehicle overseas. Obviously, I get back on the phone with customer support and ask to have either or. No help once again. "" Nothing in our system shows that you sent a check or your account is paid in full. '' Jokes on you this time Kia, I have a tracking number from USPS that shows that it has been delivered. Arguing all day long that they have my money and all I need from them is nothing more than a piece of paper, a supervisor in the morning tells me that as soon the check is received they will process it and email it to me and fax it to the shipping company ( at this point they have not yet picked up the package at their",10,"['atached', 'ful', 'complaint', 'ben', 'financing', 'kia', 'soul', 'kia',

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I exchanged XXXX for several Reloadit card codes at localbitcoins.com in order to exchange XXXX for XXXX. I made several transactions with one user there, each one was for a value of {$500.00} USD, each one i loaded into my "" safe '' in my account at reloadit.com. The rules say i could load up to XXXX $ per day and $ 10k per account. After a couple weeks Reloadit locked my accounts with a total of {$3000.00} in them. I called and opened a case, and provided the documentation they asked for right away. 
I can write an entire complaint based on the incredibly atrocious customer service. There were lies, rudeness, deliberate disconnections ( hang-ups ), and smug behavior as they enjoyed hearing me getting angry and helpless. One supervisor even laughed at me when i asked for his employee number so i could make note of this and report it ( XXXX, employee # XXXX ) I wo n't go into the detail of the XXXX phones calls i made getting jerked around, and hours i spent on hold just to be asked a few questions to be put on hold again to be transferred to someone else ( cycle repeats ). 
They ignored the fact that i provided the correct documentation and asked for the store receipts of the purchases which they knew i could not produce because i told them i obtained these codes via XXXX. I do have documentation showing that i obtained these codes through the service at XXXX. i submitted screen shots of all the invoices/receipts from the transactions. They have ignored this evidence and then last i called they told me i have 2 hours to submit the receipts from the store or my case will be closed forever without possibility to reopen it again.. Now they WILL NOT EVEN LET ME SPEAK TO THAT DEPARTMENT. I ca n't speak to anyone who has the pwower to unlock my account and each person i speak to that would be able to transfer me has explicit instructions to not allow me to speak to them. 
I fell like i have been robbed and violated. I am not out of {$3000.00} and feel completely helpless. I would like to take full action against this company and i know there are others like me who this is happening to. The reason i knew to file this complaint is because i shared my story on the forum at XXXX and have learned that his has happened to many others. Blackhawk Network must be stopped and prosecuted for robbing the consumers. 
On a final note, my girlfriend has an account with {$1000.00} in it and every time she tries to withdraw the money she gets an error, this has been happening for several days and it 's beginning to appear as though her money is being robbed as well.",7,"['exchanged', 'xx', 'several', 'reloadit', 'card', 'code', 'localbitcoinscom', 'order', 'exchange', 'xx', 'xx', 'made', 'several', 'transaction', 'one', 'user', 'one', 'value', 'usd', 'one', 'loaded', 'safe', 'acount', 'reloaditcom', 'rule', 'say', 'could', 'load', 'xx', 'per', 'day', 'k', 'per', 'acount', 'couple', 'weks', 'reloadit', 'locked', 'acounts', 'total', 'caled', 'opened', 'case', 'provided', 'documentation', 'asked', 'right', 'away', 'write', 'entire', 'complaint', 'based', 'incredibly', 'atrocious', 'customer', 'service', 'lie', 'rudenes', 'deliberate', 'disconections', 'hangups', 'smug', 'behavior', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'geting', 'angry', 'helples', 'one', 'supervisor', 'even', 'laughed', 'asked', 'employe', 'number', 'could', 'make', 'note', 'report', 'xx', 'employe', 'xx', 'wo', 'nt', 'go', 'detail', 'xx', 'phone', 'cals', 'made', 'geting', 'jerked', 'around', 'hour', 'spent', 'hold', 'asked', 'question', 'put', 'hold', 'transfered', 'someone', 'else', 'cycle', 'repeat', 'ignored', 'fact', 'provided', 'corect', 'documentation', 'asked', 'store', 'receipt', 'purchase', 'knew', 'could', 'produce', 'told', 'obtained', 'code', 'via', 'xx', 'documentation', 'showing', 'obtained', 'code', 'service', 'xx', 'submited', 'scren', 'shot', 'al', 'invoicesreceipts', 'transaction', 'ignored', 'evidence', 'last', 'caled', 'told', 'hour', 'submit', 'receipt', 'store', 'case', 'wil', 'closed', 'forever', 'without', 'posibility', 'reopen', 'wil', 'even', 'let', 'speak', 'department', 'ca', 'nt', 'speak', 'anyone', 'pwower', 'unlock', 'acount', 'person', 'speak', 'would', 'able', 'transfer', 'explicit', 'instruction', 'alow', 'speak', 'fel', 'like', 'ben', 'robed', 'violated', 'fel', 'completely', 'helples', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'ful', 'action', 'company', 'know', 'others', 'like', 'hapening', 'reason', 'knew', 'file', 'complaint', 'shared', 'story', 'forum', 'xx', 'learned', 'hapened', 'many', 'others', 'blackhawk', 'network', 'must', 'stoped', 'prosecuted', 'robing', 'consumer', 'final', 'note', 'girlfriend', 'acount', 'every', 'time', 'try', 'withdraw', 'money', 'get', 'eror', 'ben', 'hapening', 'several', 'day', 'begining', 'apear', 'though', 'money', 'robed', 'wel']",exchanged xx several reloadit card code localbitcoinscom order exchange xx xx made several transaction one user one value usd one loaded safe acount reloaditcom rule say could load xx per day k per acount couple weks reloadit locked acounts total caled opened case provided documentation asked right away write entire complaint based incredibly atrocious customer service lie rudenes deliberate disconections hangups smug behavior enjoyed hearing geting angry helples one supervisor even laughed asked employe number could make note report xx employe xx wo nt go detail xx phone cals made geting jerked around hour spent hold asked question put hold transfered someone else cycle repeat ignored fact provided corect documentation asked store receipt purchase knew could produce told obtained code via xx documentation showing obtained code service xx submited scren shot al invoicesreceipts transaction ignored evidence last caled told hour submit receipt store case wil closed forever without posibility reopen wil even let speak department ca nt speak anyone pwower unlock acount person speak would able transfer explicit instruction alow speak fel like ben robed violated fel completely helples would like take ful action company know others like hapening reason knew file complaint shared story forum xx learned hapened many others blackhawk network must stoped prosecuted robing consumer final note girlfriend acount every time try withdraw money get eror ben hapening several day begining apear though money robed wel
Bank account or service,"Plain and simple : Scottrade has enormous hidden fees and cost me over {$200.00}. 

I opened an account with Scottrade a while ago and the branch manager that assisted in the account opening pretty much swore that the only fees are the {$7.00} per trade. Well that could not be more false. The additional and hidden fees at Scottrade are enormous and Scottrade does charge more than {$7.00} per trade. 

What is most worrisome is that Scottrade could not explain each one of these fees for me and instead repeatedly asked me to call the national center for advice. The national center could not answer them either, only stated that they would get back to me within a week. 

Well, it has been a week and I have still not heard of any explanation to the fees and whether I will get any reimbursement to my account.

Bank account or service,"I have an executed agreement to purchase a home owned by The Bank of New York Mellon through their agent, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Prior to closing, a roof repair was done ; however, the party who did the repairs failed to obtain a building permit or professionally complete the repairs. During the walk through it was evident that the roof was still leaking. A licensed roofing contractor provided me with an inspection and estimate to replace the roof since a repair is not permitted. The city building department confirmed that a complete roof replacement is required and has issued a stop work order posted on the property. The roof must be replaced by a licensed roofing contractor, it is now a code enforcement issue. The seller initially argued regarding who did repairs ( not material ) and insisted I close as is or cancel the contract. I could not obtain insurance with the leaking roof. The seller would only refund my {$5000.00} escrow deposit and refused to pay my direct expenses over {$1100.00}. I have a FHA loan approved, and the lender 's loan package was sent to the closing agent in a timely manner so there was no issue with the loan on the closing date, XXXX XXXX, 2015. The seller came back after about a week and told my real estate broker, XXXX XXXX that the seller would replace the roof and to confirm if I still wanted to purchase the property which I responded affirmatively. Today, I received an email to call XXXX XXXX, after agreeing to replace the roof the seller now is refusing to do as they said they would do. I want to purchase the house and I want the roof to be replaced as they agreed to do.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I called the XXXX XXXX section of XXXX to book a room regarding my free anniversary night ( see below ). 
They said they will not honor it now -would only do up to a category 4 hotel ( which does not cover the hotel I chose ) as the program changed.

They said that numerous emails went out the last few months regarding a merger with another hotel chain, but did not specify that our earned certificates would no longer be honored.

Mortgage,"On or around    XX/XX/XXXX ,   my offer to purchase  XXXX   XXXX  was accepted with a loan pre-approval letter from   XXXX   XXXX    for   {$940000.00} at the rate o f 3.65 %. A  few days later when I went to Bank of America to withdraw the funds for the deposit to open escrow, the bank manager introduce me to Bank of America  loan   officer   XXXX   XXXX     XXXX  who pre-approved me with a loan from Bank of America for {$940000.00} at the rate  of 3.25 %.  I submitted the loan application with Bank of America on    XX/XX/XXXX    and followed  XXXX  loan processing instructions.   F or five w eeks,  XXXX  would request for information with very short time line. Sometimes the unreasonable timeline was a short as a few hours. As if  XXXX  expected us to be on alert with his emails and phone calls and dropped what we are doing and responded to him right away.   I have a  credit score  of  XXXX . I have enough down payment and income for the loan approval.  XXXX  even congratulated me and my real estate agent in the later part  of  XX/XX/XXXX  for the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX , t he Bank of America loan coordinator,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   stated that the loan commitment letter will be issued at the latest   on  XX/XX/XXXX  morning.
However, 0n  XX/XX/XXXX  afternoon, my agent and I received a conference call from Bank of America manager    XXXX   XXXX  stating that the loan is denied based on my income to debt ratio. Bank of America sent out a letter of denial confirmation o n  XX/XX/XXXX .    I immediately went to  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and started the loan application again. In  one month, my loan was approved for the same loan amount with a 4.8 % inte rest rate and I purchased the property and the escrow was closed on    XX/XX/XXXX .
Since  XX/XX/XXXX  t  o now, I have been working with Bank of America to try to understand why my loan with Bank of America was denied. I have been blocked by  XXXX   XXXX  and  XXXX   XXXX   (    XXXX s manager  ) to find out the truth, stating that it is their trade secret. Both of them did not find our why  XXXX  congratulated us on the loan.  XXXX  just apologized for  XXXX  on her verbal loan commitment.  XXXX  claimed that he can not disclose lending guidelines because it is proprietary and internal information of Bank of America. I just want to know the detail why my loan was disapproved rather tha n just one  simple phrase of Debt to income rate : excessive obligation in relation to income.   If this is true, then my loan with  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   at a higher interest rate will not be approved. I feel that the true reasons were the interest rate after the election has gone up tremendously ; I am a senior person and I am  XXXX . I feel that their thinking is no matter what they do to me I have to lay flat and let them bully me without complaint. The damage for the interest differential in the loan from  3.25 to 4.8 % for 3 0 years is in excess of {$400000.00}. My incurred financial damage caused by Bank of America is huge.",0,"['around', 'xxxx', 'ofer', 'purchase', 'xx', 'xx', 'acepted', 'loan', 'preaproval', 'leter', 'xx', 'xx', 'rate', 'f', 'day', 'later', 'went', 'bank', 'america', 'withdraw', 'fund', 'deposit', 'open', 'escrow', 'bank', 'manager', 'introduce', 'bank', 'america', 'loan', 'oficer', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'preaproved', 'loan', 'bank', 'america', 'rate', 'submited', 'loan', 'aplication', 'bank', 'america', 'xxxx', 'folowed', 'xx', 'loan', 'procesing', 'instruction', 'f', 'five', 'w', 'eks', 'xx', 'would', 'request', 'information', 'short', 'time', 'line', 'sometimes', 'unreasonable', 'timeline', 'short', 'hour', 'xx', 'expected', 'u', 'alert', 'email', 'phone', 'cals', 'droped', 'responded', 'right', 'away', 'credit', 'score', 'xx', 'enough', 'payment', 'income', 'loan', 'aproval', 'xx', 'even', 'congratulated', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'later', 'part', 'xxxx', 'loan', 'xxxx', 'bank', 'america', 'loan', 'cordinator', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'stated', 'loan', 'comitment', 'leter', 'wil', 'isued', 'latest', 'xxxx', 'morning', 'however', 'n', 'xxxx', 'afternon', 'agent', 'received', 'conference', 'cal', 'bank', 'america', 'manager', 'xx', 'xx', 'stating', 'loan', 'denied', 'based', 'income', 'debt', 'ratio', 'bank', 'america', 'sent', 'leter', 'denial', 'confirmation', 'n', 'xxxx', 'imediately', 'went', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'started', 'loan', 'aplication', 'one', 'month', 'loan', 'aproved', 'loan', 'amount', 'inte', 'rest', 'rate', 'purchased', 'property', 'escrow', 'closed', 'xxxx', 'since', 'xxxx', 'ben', 'working', 'bank', 'america', 'try', 'understand', 'loan', 'bank', 'america', 'denied', 'ben', 'blocked', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'manager', 'find', 'truth', 'stating', 'trade', 'secret', 'find', 'xx', 'congratulated', 'u', 'loan', 'xx', 'apologized', 'xx', 'verbal', 'loan', 'comitment', 'xx', 'claimed', 'disclose', 'lending', 'guideline', 'proprietary', 'internal', 'information', 'bank', 'america', 'want', 'know', 'detail', 'loan', 'disaproved', 'rather', 'tha', 'n', 'one', 'simple', 'phrase', 'debt', 'income', 'rate', 'excesive', 'obligation', 'relation', 'income', 'true', 'loan', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'higher', 'interest', 'rate', 'wil', 'aproved', 'fel', 'true', 'reason', 'interest', 'rate', 'election', 'gone', 'tremendously', 'senior', 'person', 'xx', 'fel', 'thinking', 'mater', 'lay', 'flat', 'let', 'buly', 'without', 'complaint', 'damage', 'interest', 'diferential', 'loan', 'year', 'exces', 'incured', 'financial', 'damage', 'caused', 'bank', 'america', 'huge']",around xxxx ofer purchase xx xx acepted loan preaproval leter xx xx rate f day later went bank america withdraw fund deposit open escrow bank manager introduce bank america loan oficer xx xx xx preaproved loan bank america rate submited loan aplication bank america xxxx folowed xx loan procesing instruction f five w eks xx would request information short time line sometimes unreasonable timeline short hour xx expected u alert email phone cals droped responded right away credit score xx enough payment income loan aproval xx even congratulated real estate agent later part xxxx loan xxxx bank america loan cordinator xx xx xx stated loan comitment leter wil isued latest xxxx morning however n xxxx afternon agent received conference cal bank america manager xx xx stating loan denied based income debt ratio bank america sent leter denial confirmation n xxxx imediately went xx xx xx xx started loan aplication one month loan aproved loan amount inte rest rate purchased property escrow closed xxxx since xxxx ben working bank america try understand loan bank america denied ben blocked xx xx xx xx xx manager find truth stating trade secret find xx congratulated u loan xx apologized xx verbal loan comitment xx claimed disclose lending guideline proprietary internal information bank america want know detail loan disaproved rather tha n one simple phrase debt income rate excesive obligation relation income true loan xx xx xx xx higher interest rate wil aproved fel true reason interest rate election gone tremendously senior person xx fel thinking mater lay flat let buly without complaint damage interest diferential loan year exces incured financial damage caused bank america huge
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I suffered ID theft at the hands of XXXX XXXX XXXX where they used my social security number for someone else 's account in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. This cause severe damage to my 35 years of perfect credit. I hired XXXX XXXX to help me. They did a very good job at getting this fixed but in XX/XX/XXXX they lost legal representation in my state of North Carolina. This left me with no choice but fixing my scores on my own and cleaning up incorrect credit information. I did pretty good with most of my left issues with the exception of dealing with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They are a major issue and totally unresponsive. Therefore, at the beginning of this year I hired CreditRepair.com. They said they could help with all my remaining issues. Instead, I discovered they are hard to get in touch with. Their people do not follow though or do anything. Their departments do not work in harmony with each other too. As a result, my credit scores have been going down instead of up even though I have not missed a single payment on any of my responsibilities. When I called them today I found a recording saying their staff was in meetings and their phone system hung up without taking a message. I tried using their chat function and that showed they were closed today during normal business hours. So I sent them an email message saying I wanted a complete refund and for them to stop charging me. They need to deal with my request immediately along with fixing their issues or be investigated and/or shutdown as a service.

Bank account or service,"A check I deposited into my checking account on XXXX did not show as available on XXXX as it should have. I was told by XXXX Chase customer service when I called and inquired into the funds not showing as available to me late on XXXX that the funds would be available on XXXX. The check did not show available on XXXX or on XXXX so I again called their customer service and requested to speak to someone higher up. I was told that it was the amount of the check that was the issue. The check was for {$3500.00}. I have deposited checks from the individual whom wrote me this check in amounts this large and larger and had never had an issue with having to wait more than one day for the funds. I also found out from my fathers Financial advisor at XXXX XXXX that XXXX Chase had indeed cashed the check on XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and was told all 3 times that I needed to give them a # from XXXX XXXX so they could verify the cash had been checked. I gave them my fathers financial advisor 's name, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX of her phone numbers to please verify that the check was cashed so I could get my rightful deposit. When I checked on XXXX the money had still not been deposited into my checking account but was showing still "" On hold ''. I called cust service one more time to see why the check had been cashed by them, told me on XXXX that it would show as available to me in my checking account on XXXX, yet now on XXXX was on hold. I was again was told it was the check amount, and I again pointed out the check was cashed at XXXX XXXX on XXXX. I also asked when they had planned to advise me of the on hold issue. I was told they would send me a letter in the mail, and I advised I would be filing a complaint with the XXXX which I did and JPMorgan 's Executive Office did not reply to. XXXX # XXXX. The funds did not show up as available to me until XXXX. The funds were needed by me vitally by XXXX that is why I deposited the check on XXXX. I checked my account on line every day for it. When I received my next bank statement from JPMorgan it showed a check date and funds available to me date of XXXX. I again called their customer service to ask what the date on the monthly statement reflected : The date the check was physically deposited or the date that the funds became available to me. I was told the date would be the date the funds were placed in to my checking account and were available to me. The bank statement was false. I then checked the detail on my account on line and the funds, which did not show available until XXXX as I was checking daily, now showed that they were available to me on XXXX. And I was charged {$34.00} for a bounced check between those dates. Therefore it is apparent that the date was changed and therefore my statement and my online account information had been falsely reported by JPMorgan. An audit of my banking records would on the surface show what I typed above to be false. However If their system were looked into I would it showed that what the date that the actual entry was made, which would indicate the true XXXX date. I find this to be falsification of my official banking statement and records, improper business practices, dishonest and poor ethics.",9,"['check', 'deposited', 'checking', 'acount', 'xx', 'show', 'available', 'xx', 'told', 'xx', 'chase', 'customer', 'service', 'caled', 'inquired', 'fund', 'showing', 'available', 'late', 'xx', 'fund', 'would', 'available', 'xx', 'check', 'show', 'available', 'xx', 'xx', 'caled', 'customer', 'service', 'requested', 'speak', 'someone', 'higher', 'told', 'amount', 'check', 'isue', 'check', 'deposited', 'check', 'individual', 'wrote', 'check', 'amount', 'large', 'larger', 'never', 'isue', 'wait', 'one', 'day', 'fund', 'also', 'found', 'father', 'financial', 'advisor', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'chase', 'inded', 'cashed', 'check', 'xx', 'caled', 'spoke', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'told', 'al', 'time', 'neded', 'give', 'xx', 'xx', 'could', 'verify', 'cash', 'ben', 'checked', 'gave', 'father', 'financial', 'advisor', 'name', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'phone', 'number', 'please', 'verify', 'check', 'cashed', 'could', 'get', 'rightful', 'deposit', 'checked', 'xx', 'money', 'stil', 'ben', 'deposited', 'checking', 'acount', 'showing', 'stil', 'hold', 'caled', 'cust', 'service', 'one', 'time', 'se', 'check', 'ben', 'cashed', 'told', 'xx', 'would', 'show', 'available', 'checking', 'acount', 'xx', 'yet', 'xx', 'hold', 'told', 'check', 'amount', 'pointed', 'check', 'cashed', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'also', 'asked', 'planed', 'advise', 'hold', 'isue', 'told', 'would', 'send', 'leter', 'mail', 'advised', 'would', 'filing', 'complaint', 'xx', 'jpmorgan', 'executive', 'ofice', 'reply', 'xx', 'xx', 'fund', 'show', 'available', 'xx', 'fund', 'neded', 'vitaly', 'xx', 'deposited', 'check', 'xx', 'checked', 'acount', 'line', 'every', 'day', 'received', 'next', 'bank', 'statement', 'jpmorgan', 'showed', 'check', 'date', 'fund', 'available', 'date', 'xx', 'caled', 'customer', 'service', 'ask', 'date', 'monthly', 'statement', 'reflected', 'date', 'check', 'physicaly', 'deposited', 'date', 'fund', 'became', 'available', 'told', 'date', 'would', 'date', 'fund', 'placed', 'checking', 'acount', 'available', 'bank', 'statement', 'false', 'checked', 'detail', 'acount', 'line', 'fund', 'show', 'available', 'xx', 'checking', 'daily', 'showed', 'available', 'xx', 'charged', 'bounced', 'check', 'betwen', 'date', 'therefore', 'aparent', 'date', 'changed', 'therefore', 'statement', 'online', 'acount', 'information', 'ben', 'falsely', 'reported', 'jpmorgan', 'audit', 'banking', 'record', 'would', 'surface', 'show', 'typed', 'false', 'however', 'system', 'loked', 'would', 'showed', 'date', 'actual', 'entry', 'made', 'would', 'indicate', 'true', 'xx', 'date', 'find', 'falsification', 'oficial', 'banking', 'statement', 'record', 'improper', 'busines', 'practice', 'dishonest', 'por', 'ethic']",check deposited checking acount xx show available xx told xx chase customer service caled inquired fund showing available late xx fund would available xx check show available xx xx caled customer service requested speak someone higher told amount check isue check deposited check individual wrote check amount large larger never isue wait one day fund also found father financial advisor xx xx xx chase inded cashed check xx caled spoke xx xx xx told al time neded give xx xx could verify cash ben checked gave father financial advisor name xx xx xx phone number please verify check cashed could get rightful deposit checked xx money stil ben deposited checking acount showing stil hold caled cust service one time se check ben cashed told xx would show available checking acount xx yet xx hold told check amount pointed check cashed xx xx xx also asked planed advise hold isue told would send leter mail advised would filing complaint xx jpmorgan executive ofice reply xx xx fund show available xx fund neded vitaly xx deposited check xx checked acount line every day received next bank statement jpmorgan showed check date fund available date xx caled customer service ask date monthly statement reflected date check physicaly deposited date fund became available told date would date fund placed checking acount available bank statement false checked detail acount line fund show available xx checking daily showed available xx charged bounced check betwen date therefore aparent date changed therefore statement online acount information ben falsely reported jpmorgan audit banking record would surface show typed false however system loked would showed date actual entry made would indicate true xx date find falsification oficial banking statement record improper busines practice dishonest por ethic

Mortgage,"I would like to file a complaint against Bank of America and XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX we approached our mortgage lender Bank of America ( BOA ). We wanted to refinance our home that we have lived in since XX/XX/XXXX. At the time we approached BOA we were not in foreclose, we were current on all of our loan payments and we were not in distress. BOA turned us down for a conventional refinanced mortgage loan but offered us what they explained was a NEW program for customers that were current with their mortgage but wanted to reduce their payments. We were excited about the new program unknowing that it would hurt our credit and put our home into a foreclosure situation. Our loan officer said we were accepted into the program and our payments were being reduced approximately {$540.00} per month. We were told to make this payment for three months and the new loan would be in place after that. We asked our loan officer if the mortgage came back unacceptable could we refuse it, pay back the difference and keep the original mortgage. Our loan officer reinsured us that we could do this without penalty or credit damage. After three months past, we contacted BOA ; Our loan officer informed us that it was taking longer than expected but to keep paying the monthly mortgage at the reduced rate. 
After the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th months BOA keep giving us the same story, it was taking longer than expected, it 's not you ( the homeowner ) but the bank that is having issues with the paperwork, BOA instructed us to keep paying our scheduled reduced mortgage and the contract will come soon. It was on the Ninth month that the new mortgage plan finally came. The new mortgage plan was a disaster and we went from a 23 year mortgage to a 40 year mortgage with a balloon payment at the end. 
For obvious reasons we refused this new mortgage plan and continued with the existing mortgage. We never signed or entered into any new agreements that BOA or XXXX provide. No acceptance to their terms or conditions was accepted. It was only after refusing the new mortgage that BOA destroyed our credit and sold off our mortgage to XXXX. Once XXXX took over the loan it went downhill from there. XXXX would not discuss any terms or help us with the issues that BOA left us in. We paid large fees to XXXX that they forced us to pay to keep our home out of foreclose. All during the time while this was happening I still made my monthly payments on time, and every month with documentation of every payment. XXXX is a debt collecting company and they also duplicated bad credit reporting from BOA. 
I 'm attaching a letter from Ice Legal to BOA as evidence of my complaint ; I 'm also attaching a letter from BOA saying that they would partially correct our credit report and that it was done in error. Also I have requested a payment history on all payments made to BOA and XXXX. To this day I have not received any payment records nor have they corrected the errors on the XXXX credit reporting bureaus I 'm requesting that BOA and XXXX correct and remove all of the damaging information that 's on all three credit reporting bureaus. The dates and information that they are reporting are wrong and should not be there in the first place. BOA and XXXX knowingly and willingly took advantage of us and should have never offered us a loan that would cause us harm to our credit and possible foreclose to our home. I believe what BOA did was illegal and misleading, and there actions should be investigated. How many other hard working customers have they purposely for sole purpose only destroyed their credit and tried to take their home? I have personal bank records that show the history that I have made every loan payment including the trial payments on time from the beginning of the loan XX/XX/XXXX.

Checking or savings account,"I received a promotion in the mail fr om Santander Ban k to open a ne w Business Account  with them in exchange for a {$500.00} bonus. The requirements for the bonus were to maintain an average daily value of more than {$1000.00} for more than 3 months.  <P/> I opened the account with a banker and a {$100.00} deposit. The banker said I could deposit the rest of the money when I got my debit card, which did n't arrive  for 2 weeks. A s soon as I got the debit card I deposited {$1000.00}. I then kept the balance of my new account above {$1000.00} for the proceeding 4 months.  <P/> I saw no bonus deposited, so followed up  with Santander who r eviewed and denied the bonus twice, citing that I had not maintained an average daily value of over {$1000.00} for 3 months.  <P/> It is misleading that the promotion was advertised in such terms, I deposited the funds as soon as I was able ( once I had received my banking card ). If the requirements were to have {$1000.00} in the account from the day the account was opened, they should ha ve A ) explicitly said so in the promotion they sent me, and B ) the banker should have indicated this.

Student loan,"I would like to report PHEAAs unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices that left me damaged financially. I am seeking to be made whole. I, along with my debt advocate XXXX, called PHEAA on XX/XX/XXXX regarding my defaulted loan balance. The customer rep was XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX proceeded to explain PHEAAs rehabilitation program and asked me a series of questions to determine the amount I would have to pay monthly. One of the  questions XXXX ( my debt advocate ) asked XXXX was whether my Federal Income Tax refund check which had been previously intercepted by the Fiscal Service of the Treasury Dept. would be intercepted upon establishing the payment program. XXXX  response was that as soon as I enrolled in the rehab program, my tax refund check would no longer be intercepted and reiterated that I needed to complete my enrollment in the program while she had us on the phone. She then said I needed to sign some documents right away to start the process. She proceeded to send me documents via email that needed to be signed using XXXX. XXXX also processed an initial payment to verify my payment bank account. 

While on the phone, XXXX repeatedly asked XXXX to explain the terms ( fine print ) contained in the 10-payment agreement document that I was asked to sign while on the phone. XXXX mentioned multiple times that since there wasnt enough time for her to independently review the document, her presence on the phone call was to ensure that none of the terms would harm me or the debt management process I had embarked on. XXXX then said that she too was wary of my having my debt advocate on the call since she was also acting in my best interest and would explain everything on the document I was asked to sign. XXXX went on to explain the terms of the payment agreement and confirm yet again that my tax refund check would not be intercepted once I enrolled in the program that day. I signed the documents as soon as I received the email with XXXX on the line, with XXXX then verifying that I signed it correctly. 

I later filed my tax returns with my tax accountant in XXXX and to my shock, on XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a letter from the Treasury Dept. saying my refund check had been intercepted and sent to PHEAA. I emailed XXXX immediately to find out why this was the case because she had confirmed it would not happen. She did not respond until I called PHEAA after a week on XX/XX/XXXX and surprisingly got XXXX as my PHEAA for the second time. 

On the call on XX/XX/XXXX, I reminded XXXX of our call with my debt advocate ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and asked why my check was intercepted and she said she had given me the wrong information that the rules were changed in XX/XX/XXXX that 5 successful draft payments were required to be made before interceptions could be removed from the rehab program account. I complained that she never gave me that information and I reminded her that my debt advocate ( XXXX ) specifically asked her more than once of PHEAAs rules on interception of refund checks. I made it clear that she misinformed me and that as a result of this misinformation, my refund got intercepted. I immediately requested that PHEAA release the check back to me to rectify this error and she said she had to speak to her supervisor and I was put on hold for several minutes. She came back and said the call transcript from XX/XX/XXXX was pulled and reviewed and it was confirmed she indeed gave me wrong information, but that her supervisor said the check would not be released. XXXX apologized for the wrong information and let me know it was now out of her hands. XXXX appeared to be aware of PHEAAs unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to complain again and see if I could get remedy for the damages I sustained based on PHEAAs misrepresentation to me. I got rep. XXXX XXXX. I detailed my call on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and she looked at the notes on my account and said she could not do anything. I ask to speak with a supervisor. XXXX then put me on hold and came back and said the supervisor said the check will not be released. I was not allowed to speak with a supervisor. I ask to speak with the supervisor 's higher up and she put me on hold again and then came back and said that she was sorry that XXXX gave me the wrong info. The supervisors she spoke with were XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. From the way XXXX ( on the second conversation ) and XXXX spoke to me, it appeared that these representatives are aware of predatory practices by PHEAA. At no pint was I allowed to speak with a supervisor despite my repeated attempts to speak with one. Each time the representatives went back and forth to speak with the supervisor and always ended up saying they did not have the power to do anything yet was never allowed to speak with the person that did. They acted scared and aware of unethical practices enforced by supervisors at PHEAA. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the CFPB ( XXXX ) and PHEAA documented that a representative reached out to me on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the requirement to have the offset cease. However, PHEAAs representation to CFPB was deceptive and in no way provided any resolution. In fact, they mentioned reviewing my tax returns which does not address their deceptive misrepresentation and the need to remedy the financial damages I sustained by their actions. 

An acceptable resolution is for PHEAA to return the check due to me that was wrongly intercepted. I was hurried asked to sign documents over the phone and despite repeatedly asking XXXX about the details of the program she was offering, she misinformed me about the details of the program. I did exactly as she instructed me to and as a result, my refund check was intercepted. During my call on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX admitted to have given me the wrong information and spoke with her supervisor. She confirmed the call on XX/XX/XXXX was reviewed with the supervisor and confirmed she gave me the wrong information while urging me to sign the payment agreement documents over the phone. 

I would like this matter escalated because PHEAA has proven to be unethical, deceptive, and abusive in their dealings with me. The only acceptable remediation is for PHEAA to return the tax refund check in the full amount back to me.",8,"['would', 'like', 'report', 'pheas', 'unfair', 'deceptive', 'abusive', 'act', 'practice',

Consumer Loan,"XXXX/XXXX/2016 With all the financial and credit concerns going on with the XXXX XXXX situation, I wanted to ask ... Is it legal for a lending company to report the terms of your agreement different from what you sighed? 

I have an Auto loan with PNC Bank and per our "" Direct Installment Loan Disclosure and Note Agreement '' here are the following terms .... 

XXXX Number of Payments : 36 XXXX Amount of Payments : {$370.00} XXXX When Payments Are Due : Monthly, beginning XX/XX/2016 I have found out that all three credit reporting agencies XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, are reporting that my repayments terms are for 38 months instead of 36. Thiscalculation worksout to bea differentsof {$750.00} more when you use that number. 

When PNC Bank contacted me by mailoffering to refinance my auto, one of the main selling points was that they allow you to chose from 30 to 90 days before your first payment isdue, I choose the 90 days. 

I signed the Agreement in the XXXX Virginia location on XX/XX/2016 and thefirst payment isdue on XX/XX/2016, around 90 days. 

They are telling me since the funds where available onthe date I signed, they have a right to report38 months instead of 36. 

I was in the process of doing aDebt consolidation loan, when this was brought to my attention. They are saying that they will have to add the $ XXXXdifferents of 2 monthsin order to do a pay off for my auto since PNC Bank is reporting 38 months as the terms of repayment. 

On XX/XX/2016 I called PNC Bank, the person I spoke with concerning this matter is Name XXXX XXXX in the Escalation Department of PNC Bank XXXX. He acknowledge that the contract I signed was for a repayment term of 36 months, but that they have a right to report 38 months instead of 36 months. He refused to transfer me to his supervisor or anyone in the so called "" Back Office People Dept '' and that he was the manager and there was no one else I could speak to concerning this matter. 

I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read and review this compliant.

Mortgage,"I suffered a home fire on XX/XX/XXXX ... .unbeknownst to me XXXX XXXX XXXX allowed my insurance to lapse in XX/XX/XXXX .... Then they transferred servicing my mortgage to GREENTREE . GREENTREE activated a forced-place policy on my home and now it 's XXXX XXXX years later and I am constantly battling with them to transfer money allotted to me from the insurance company to rebuild the home. I have since purchased a manufactured home, disassembled the burnt structure, cleaned the foundation and installed the manufactured home on the foundation.

Bank account or service,"I have maintained my checking account with Chase Bank ( formerly Bank One ) in good standing since XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited a check in the amount of {$1800.00} to my checking account at the local Chase Bank branch located on XXXX in XXXX, WI. The check came from someone I had sold an item to over XXXX. It was over the amount of the item sold by {$1600.00}, the buyer was moving to where I live, and I was asked by the buyer to send the remaining amount back to the buyer 's moving company. The buyer repeatedly asked me if she could trust me with the extra money, and I told her that she could trust me as long as her check cleared. 

Since I did not know the buyer, I wanted to be certain that the funds were in my account before I sent any money. I visited my local branch on XX/XX/XXXX and explained the situation to the Bank Manager, XXXX, and asked for his advice on when it would be safe for me to send the money. His advice was to not send any money until Chase Bank had collected the funds, and funds had been deposited to my account. He told me to check back later in the day or the next day. I called the Chase Bank toll free number the next morning and was told that funds had been collected and deposited into my account, and it was safe for me to send the money. I then visited my local branch where a teller ( XXXX ) confirmed this information. She explained that she could now verify that funds had been physically collected from the issuing bank and been deposited into my account. She assured me that it was now safe for me to send the money. Upon getting this confirmation in person, I withdrew {$1600.00} from my checking account and sent it to the moving company via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX 

The next morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that Chase had withdrawn the money from my account as the check had bounced. I immediately visited the Bank Manager to inquire about what had happened. After looking into it he informed me that the check was indeed fraudulent and had bounced. He said that even though they had confirmed that money had been collected and deposited into my account, the bank had a right to withdraw funds from my account. He told me that the bank bears no responsibility for bounced checks, and that there was nothing further they could do to assist me. I asked him why I was not provided this information earlier when I had repeatedly asked for it. He had no answer for me, and instead scrambled to look for bank policies. After discussing with other managers, he provided me with highlighted bank policy, which he said was given to me when I opened the account, which was almost 30 years ago. I later filed a complaint with Chase Corporate office, and after a few days I was informed that everything was handled appropriately, that bank policies are listed in the deposit agreement, and that bank officials were not obligated to provide me with the information I had repeatedly requested. 

I believe I did the due diligence on my part to protect myself from this fraudulent transaction. I trusted my bank to protect my interests, but even after my repeated inquiries, the Bank Manager and rest of bank staff failed to inform me of applicable bank policies. They only looked for bank policies after funds had already been sent and the check had bounced, and informed me that it was my responsibility to be aware of the policies. I believe that it was bank staff 's responsibility to provide me this information, especially after I had repeatedly asked them for bank policies on when it would be safe for me to send the money. I believe the reason I was not provided this information is because the Bank Manager and rest of the bank staff were either not aware of these policies themselves due to inadequate training on bank policies regarding fraudulent transactions, or they dealt with me with negligence.",9,"['maintained', 'checking', 'acount', 'chase', 'bank', 'formerly', 'bank', 'one', 'god', 'standing', 'since',

Checking or savings account,"I have been a loyal Suntrust Bank account holder for years. On XX/XX/XXXX I was checking my online account and noticed a XXXX over the counter withdrawal that was made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was in disbelief and very shocked. First of all, I had not been notified to even confirm that I had withdrawn this very large amount which is out of my normal transactions. Second of all I was out of state visiting a family member when the withdrawal took place and I was using my debit card.. So how could I be in 2 different places at once making different transactions. I clicked on it and it brought up the withdrawal slip and the first thing I noticed was my signature on it 2 times. On the first signature the last part of my name was crossed out with an X and my name resigned the "" correct '' way with the loop on the R of my last name XXXX. 
I immediately called the main branch on XXXX XXXX because this is where most of my transactions take place. No answer and I was sent to the branch managers voicemail. I left a message about the money that had been withdrawn by someone else other than me out of my checking account. I never even heard back from him until 2 weeks later and it wasn't even him it was another bank employee stating that his manager asked him to return my phone call. Moving forward.. After calling the XXXX XXXX I called the XXXX Suntrust number. I talked to someone in the fraud department and told them what happened and the first thing she said was that I made the withdrawal. I said no, someone else did. She would not give me any information pertaining to where this happened or who did it other than to say it would be turned over to an investigator from Suntrust and that I would be contacted within 15 business days by an investigator. 
I talked to another Suntrust location to try and find out where this withdrawal had taken place and he said Florida. I then called my local police to report this theft and had a police report filed. It was turned over to an investigator. The same day, I went to a local branch and opened a new account to transfer the bulk of my money to but couldn't close out the compromised account because items were still pending. The employee that helped me was very nice but when I told her my story and my concern with the way the transaction was handled ( meaning the double signature and that the signature was verified ) she said that procedures were followed. I did not know the full story at that time though because procedures were most certainly not followed. 
Meanwhile I played the waiting game. On XX/XX/XXXX business days later, I called Suntrust again because no one had attempted to contact me. I was told that my request would have a rush put on it and someone would contact me within 24-48 hrs. On XX/XX/XXXX, the 15th business day, an investigator finally contacted me from Suntrust and asked me questions and I told her my concerns with how the withdrawal had taken place. She said that she would turn in all the paperwork to begin the process of getting my money back and that I would need to have a paper signed in front of a notary stating that I had no involvement with this withdrawal. 
I talked to the police investigator several times through emails and phone calls and on one of those times, XX/XX/XXXX, he sent the address where someone had went inside a Suntrust Bank and withdrawn money from my account. It was address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TN XXXX I live in Georgia and have never lived in Tennessee. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the police investigator emailed me details of who walked in to a Suntrust Bank and stole money out of my account. To my knowledge Suntrust has a picture of me or my license with my picture on it to verify I am who I say I am. Not to mention countless photos over the years of me coming inside the branches or doing business at the outside of the bank through the drive-through. I am a XXXX  female who has lived in Georgia only and banked with Suntrust for numerous years. The person who stole my money is a XXXX female who used a Tennessee drivers license with my information on it. A TN drivers license!!, How she was able to do this is absurd and should have never been allowed to happen! I say allow because after everything I have seen and heard about how this took place there were absolutely no procedures in place to prevent it. 
The police investigator asked if I had received my money. I said not yet because the Suntrust investigator said that I had to wait until the police could get to the video of the transaction to make sure everything was how I described and also waiting on my signed document stating no involvement. The investigator said that Suntrust already has all this information that theyre the ones that gave it to him. Well I was shocked again because not only does Suntrust have evidence that I didn't do it, that clearly this is a case of identity theft, to top it off Suntrust again had not contacted me about any of this! This is my money!! That I chose to put into a Suntrust Bank. That I kept in all of these years and have had numerous accounts in and fees taken out, and a mortgage with, and a line of credit! 
I gave Suntrust time ( 1 business week ) and thought surely someone from Suntrust would contact me, their "" valued '' client. I was mistaken. Once again I had to be the one to contact them. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed the investigator and told her that the police investigator had already informed me of certain information that proves I am the victim of identity fraud and I did not withdraw money from my account and asked why I was not notified. I also asked that the money be returned to my account without having to sign a paper stating no involvement. She responded the same day by not answering my question as to why I haven't been contacted and apologized that I was not comfortable with the process. She said that the paper is needed to be able to be used in court as evidence against the fraudster and that as soon as I turn in the paper they will credit my account. I can not fathom that a bank would in essence aid criminals and treat their long term clients or any client as the criminal instead. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received my money back that was stolen from my account, through a teller, by a person that walked into an out of state bank XXXX per my address on file ) used an out of state license and double signed my signature and was not asked to provide a social security number. phone number or even a previous address for proof of verification. I was asked all of that when I went into a Suntrust branch to withdraw a huge, whopping XXXX bucks. Much less XXXX Although it was on the same day I reported the incidence to Suntrust and I was in there having to open up a new account and scrambling to make sure everything was done properly to ensure some safety measures. Which by the way were already in place due to an incidence of someone stealing, not my debit card, but just the numbers from my debit card twice before. That was handled pretty quickly and the money put back in my account. 
The many, many errors of Suntrust and their employee, led to my money being stolen from my account. This should never have happened. I hear it happens multiple times, every day. Not to me it doesn't. If it does why are there not better procedures in place to prevent it? Better training. Alerts, etc. Again though.. this was allowed to happen in my opinion. And to add insult to injury Im the one that has to prove Im not the criminal. Im the one that has to be worried that this person is going to do this again to me and next time all of my money will be gone and no way to live. You have all the evidence you need to know Im not the one that withdrew the money yet Im still waiting on it to be put back into my account. On top of all of that, to not even have the courtesy to call me back or to keep me informed throughout this whole process, all of it has been unacceptable. I have never been treated so poorly by a company that claims to treat everyone fairly and equitably",4,"['ben', 'loyal', 'suntrust', 'bank', 'acount', 'holder', 'year', 'xxxx', 'checking', 'online',

Vehicle loan or lease,"I, XXXX XXXX, an XXXX voter, I am going to this office to make a complaint to the XXXX XXXX. 

In XXXX, I made a XXXX year contract for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Between XXXX and XXXX my husband XXXX XXXX took the car to do the service to the car in the same XXXX XXXX. Days later my husband realizes that they changed the carpet of the driver because he took it out to clean it and to our surprise they were broken. My husband went to the XXXX to claim, and they changed it but the car also felt with a small fault and in the XXXX they said that it was the cold weather that put the cars like that. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my husband I opened the hood of the car, and we realized that the battery had been changed by a used but with much use that was seen even with the eyes closed that was in very bad condition. My husband XXXX XXXX and I went to the XXXX XXXX, and we talked to XXXX of the owners of the franchise and authorized him to change it. We spoke with XXXX of the owners so that he himself knew what was happening. 

The XXXX of the car dealers named XXXX XXXX when we were no longer my husband and I called and offered to change the car to a XXXX XXXX XXXX with a new contract of XXXX years. We asked him that it was still almost a year before he finished the contract that it was like that. The XXXX XXXX XXXX offered us that the XXXX was going to pay the rest of the contract but we did not accept the anger we had for everything they had done. 

In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I had to take the service to the car and a salesman who realized the problem we had had returned to offer to change the car and I decided with my husband to listen to the offer. The seller with the name XXXX made us the same offer that the XXXX XXXX would pay the remaining payments. I asked him what else had to be paid and the seller 's response was that the financier did not let anyone know. 

When the XXXX XXXX financier called us to finish the contract, he explained everything to me and my husband XXXX XXXX. My husband asked for the excess miles and the financier said there was no problem because the XXXX XXXX would pay for everything and also offered us for {$50.00} plus every month an insurance that covered what was not covered by the XXXX XXXX or the XXXX guarantees everything except wear as tires, battery, lights and extra miles as that insurance covered top that. Several times we asked him if he covered the odd ones, and he said yes. I agree to change the car to a XXXX XXXX XXXX under the condition of paying {$50.00} plus all months other than the {$270.00} contract payment. 





I signed several documents but the financier gave me XXXX copies and the other information he gave me in a XXXX XXXX with the name of XXXX. After XXXX days I checked the XXXX XXXX and it was empty and I immediately went to the XXXX XXXX   with my husband XXXX XXXX, and they told us that the financier XXXX XXXX had voted him a fraudster and that he would call me another financier in the next few days. 


I spend almost a month without anyone calling and I went to XXXX XXXX, and they told me to talk to another financier named XXXX XXXX and explained that the financier XXXX XXXX had fooled me that the extra {$50.00} insurance does not cover extra miles. I told the financier to cancel the contract and give me my XXXX XXXX car of XXXX and I returned the one that took the year XXXX. The financier told me that it could not because the car had already taken it to the auction that only What I could do was eliminate the extra {$50.00} insurance. I had to take it because I did not have another option, they put me between my back and the wall. 

After XXXX months it was that I received from the XXXX XXXX XXXX a statement that I have to pay {$3500.00} for excess miles. I called them on the phone and told them I did not agree with what they had scammed me. 

In conclusion in XX/XX/XXXX I made a contract for a XXXX XXXX car from XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX years later with lies offer me to pay the missing months and the extra mile payment to change the car for a XXXX XXXX. It turns out that the financier votes him for the fraudster and now I have to pay {$3500.00} for an extra mile. I asked that the car be returned to me in XXXX and cancel the contract and in XX/XX/XXXX I had XXXX options. The first I could pay the difference of the debt of the car and stay with it. The second fund the remaining debt and stay with the car paying every month a paid at the end of the car is mine. The last and the worst for me but for them the best to deliver the car and I pay {$3500.00} of extra miles under a fraud they did to me. 

Now I pay $ 270 monthly for the car in XXXX and the financier wants me to pay the {$3500.00}. I want my XXXX XXXX XXXX car back or that XXXX be responsible for the payment of {$3500.00}. 

In the last document dated XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Department has not yet registered the car as delivered.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","i am a retired XXXX of XXXX large corporations. I take great care of my credit report and especially scoring.During the last 30 days, i reduced XXXX of XXXX revolving credit accounts and zero 'd down to a credit balance on another.During that time my score dropped from XXXX to XXXX, from a previous high of XXXX. When i inquired XX/XX/XXXX during XXXX hour, XXXX individual contacts during the last contact with a supervisor named "" XXXX '' while waiting for her supervisor, i was disconnected., though my return number was verified during the call, no one called me back, calling back i was advised the company was so large identifying "" XXXX '' was impossible, even when i quierried how long the recorded calls were maintain, i was advised six ( 6 ) months. i told XXXX reason was on the XXXX 'd down account of XXXX credit, there was a XXXX charge. The other reason was, during this period XXXX ( XXXX ) previously closed, but remained open accounts from 8 years ago, "" reported '' these accounts as "" dormant/no activity account '', reviewing the credit report they show "" Paid and Closed '' I was then told these will remain for an additional ten ( 10 ) years on my report, and that I can expect my score to drop additional points in the next reporting period.i questioned these accounts since i could NOT reopen them without reapplying, again impacting my score. I was advised by "" XXXX '' that i should have maintained a monthly minimum charged balance, paying monthly on these XXXX revolving accounts, I questioned again an additional open XXXX retail charges, and was assured it would have protected my scoring, but since they have been reported in this manner they will remain for an additional ten year period, though "" closed '' paid as agreed, no activity dormant accounts. Oh a final comment, I 'm XXXX years old and in my credit history, there has NEVER been a reported late payment. There is a public note from a deeded property owned by my xwife, because of a late tax payment, i was included in the lien on my credit report on property i did not own, im also stuck with this until XX/XX/XXXX, good thing is ill have passed before this drops off, or should i sahy, ill drop off before this item. 

Thank you for what ever results you can provide, even if it opens an issue that will help others, i understand i 'm NOT the only on impacted by this practice, and I DO understand credit scoring purely drives higher interest rates for loans, again thank you, XXXX XXXX",1,"['retired', 'xx', 'xx', 'large', 'corporation', 'take', 'great', 'care', 'credit', 'report', 'especialy', 'scoringduring', 'last', 'day', 'reduced', 'xx', 'xx', 'revolving', 'credit', 'acounts', 'zero', 'credit', 'balance', 'anotherduring', 'time', 'score', 'droped', 'xx', 'xx', 'previous', 'high', 'xx', 'inquired', 'xxxx', 'xx', 'hour', 'xx', 'individual', 'contact', 'last', 'contact', 'supervisor', 'named', 'xx', 'waiting', 'supervisor', 'disconected', 'though', 'return', 'number', 'verified', 'cal', 'one', 'caled', 'back', 'caling', 'back', 'advised', 'company', 'large', 'identifying', 'xx', 'imposible', 'even', 'quieried', 'long', 'recorded', 'cals', 'maintain', 'advised', 'six', 'month', 'told', 'xx', 'reason', 'xx', 'acount', 'xx', 'credit', 'xx', 'charge', 'reason', 'period', 'xx', 'xx', 'previously', 'closed', 'remained', 'open', 'acounts', 'year', 'ago', 'reported', 'acounts', 'dormantno', 'activity', 'acount', 'reviewing', 'credit', 'report', 'show', 'paid', 'closed', 'told', 'wil', 'remain', 'aditional', 'ten', 'year', 'report', 'expect', 'score', 'drop', 'aditional', 'point', 'next', 'reporting', 'periodi', 'questioned', 'acounts', 'since', 'could', 'reopen', 'without', 'reaplying', 'impacting', 'score', 'advised', 'xx', 'maintained', 'monthly', 'minimum', 'charged', 'balance', 'paying', 'monthly', 'xx', 'revolving', 'acounts', 'questioned', 'aditional', 'open', 'xx', 'retail', 'charge', 'asured', 'would', 'protected', 'scoring', 'since', 'ben', 'reported', 'maner', 'wil', 'remain', 'aditional', 'ten', 'year', 'period', 'though', 'closed', 'paid', 'agred', 'activity', 'dormant', 'acounts', 'oh', 'final', 'coment', 'xx', 'year', 'old', 'credit', 'history', 'never', 'ben', 'reported', 'late', 'payment', 'public', 'note', 'deded', 'property', 'owned', 'xwife', 'late', 'tax', 'payment', 'included', 'lien', 'credit', 'report', 'property', 'im', 'also', 'stuck', 'xxxx', 'god', 'thing', 'il', 'pased', 'drop', 'sahy', 'il', 'drop', 'item', 'thank', 'ever', 'result', 'provide', 'even', 'open', 'isue', 'wil', 'help', 'others', 'understand', 'impacted', 'practice', 'understand', 'credit', 'scoring', 'purely', 'drive', 'higher', 'interest', 'rate', 'loan', 'thank', 'xx', 'xx']",retired xx xx large corporation take great care credit report especialy scoringduring last day reduced xx xx revolving credit acounts zero credit balance anotherduring time score droped xx xx previous high xx inquired xxxx xx hour xx individual contact last contact supervisor named xx waiting supervisor disconected though return number verified cal one caled back caling back advised company large identifying xx imposible even quieried long recorded cals maintain advised six month told xx reason xx acount xx credit xx charge reason period xx xx previously closed remained open acounts year ago reported acounts dormantno activity acount reviewing credit report show paid closed told wil remain aditional ten year report expect score drop aditional point next reporting periodi questioned acounts since could reopen without reaplying impacting score advised xx maintained monthly minimum charged balance paying monthly xx revolving acounts questioned aditional open xx retail charge asured would protected scoring since ben reported maner wil remain aditional ten year period though closed paid agred activity dormant acounts oh final coment xx year old credit history never ben reported late payment public note deded property owned xwife late tax payment included lien credit report property im also stuck xxxx god thing il pased drop sahy il drop item thank ever result provide even open isue wil help others understand impacted practice understand credit scoring purely drive higher interest rate loan thank xx xx
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I was informed by NetCredit that your payment history has been satisfactory ( 0-29 days past due ) since the beginning of your payment history. 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I received an email from NetCredit stating I owed {$200.00} ( {$100.00} for XXXX XXXX and {$100.00} for XXXX XXXX ). 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I called NetCredit to make my XXXX XXXX payment. I was transferred to the Collections Department and informed the representative that I wanted to pay what was owed for that XXXX XXXX payment. I was told I owed {$100.00} and I approved the payment. This was on day XXXX, not XXXX. I paid exactly what I was told I owed. Had I been told I owed {$150.00}, I would have paid {$150.00}. 
At the end of the call, the representative stated my account was now current and my next payment was due on XX/XX/2019. I made that payment on XX/XX/2019. 
On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I received an alert that there was a change to my credit report. It read NC FINANCIAL has flagged your account as 30 days past due. I was baffled. I assert that this is fully due to an error on the part of NetCredit and am formally requesting an adjustment. I will also submit this request via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, Sr. Compliance Associate, via telephone and was connected to her voicemail. I left a rather frantic message. I then followed up with an email. 
I logged onto my NetCredit account and there was now a message which read Your payment due on Wednesday, XX/XX/2019 is now overdue. Please make a payment as soon as possible. Again, I called in and made my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid what I was told I owed by the NetCredit Collections Department representative. 
I followed up with another email to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. At this time, my NetCredit online account showed I only owed {$100.00} for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I logged on and paid that on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I again followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I finally received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated I actually owed {$110.00} on XX/XX/2019. She stated that since I did not pay that full amount, my account was reported as 30 days late for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. If I owed that amount, why did the Collections Department representative tell me I only owed {$100.00}? Why after I paid that {$100.00} did the Collections Department representative tell me my account was paid until the next due date of XX/XX/XXXX? Why was I never told I owed {$110.00}? 
Of course I would have paid the {$110.00} if the representative had told me that was what I owed! Why would I have allowed my account to go 30 days late over {$6.00}? That is absurd! Of course I would have paid what I was told I owed when I called in on XX/XX/XXXX! I DID pay what I was told I owed! 
To show that, I immediately made a payment of {$10.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I would have paid that amount on XX/XX/XXXX, but was not told I needed to. 
At the start of the telephone call on XX/XX/2019, I was informed the call would be recorded. Locate that recording and you will hear exactly what the collections representative told me. 
I am being severely penalized over less than {$10.00}. Please remove the late report as it was due to a miscommunication in what was owed by NetCredit to me.",1,"['xx', 'xx', 'informed', 'net', 'credit', 'payment', 'history', 'ben', 'satisfactory', 'day', 'past', 'due', 'since', 'begining', 'payment', 'history', 'xx', 'xx', 'received', 'email', 'net', 'credit', 'stating', 'owed', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'caled', 'net', 'credit', 'make', 'xx', 'xx', 'payment', 'transfered', 'colections', 'department', 'informed', 'representative', 'wanted', 'pay', 'owed', 'xx', 'xx', 'payment', 'told', 'owed', 'aproved', 'payment', 'day', 'xx', 'xx', 'paid', 'exactly', 'told', 'owed', 'ben', 'told', 'owed', 'would', 'paid', 'end', 'cal', 'representative', 'stated', 'acount', 'curent', 'next', 'payment', 'due', 'xx', 'made', 'payment', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'received', 'alert', 'change', 'credit', 'report', 'read', 'nc', 'financial', 'flaged', 'acount', 'day', 'past', 'due', 'bafled', 'asert', 'fuly', 'due', 'eror', 'part', 'net', 'credit', 'formaly', 'requesting', 'adjustment', 'wil', 'also', 'submit', 'request', 'via', 'consumer', 'financial', 'protection', 'bureau', 'imediately', 'contacted', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'sr', 'compliance', 'asociate', 'via', 'telephone', 'conected', 'voicemail', 'left', 'rather', 'frantic', 'mesage', 'folowed', 'email', 'loged', 'onto', 'net', 'credit', 'acount', 'mesage', 'read', 'payment', 'due', 'wednesday', 'xx', 'overdue', 'please', 'make', 'payment', 'son', 'posible', 'caled', 'made', 'xxxx', 'payment', 'xxxx', 'paid', 'told', 'owed', 'net', 'credit', 'colections', 'department', 'representative', 'folowed', 'another', 'email', 'xx', 'xx', 'xxxx', 'time', 'net', 'credit', 'online', 'acount', 'showed', 'owed', 'xxxx', 'payment', 'loged', 'paid', 'xxxx', 'folowed', 'xx', 'xx', 'xxxx', 'finaly', 'received', 'response', 'xxxx', 'xx', 'xx', 'stated', 'actualy', 'owed', 'xx', 'stated', 'since', 'pay', 'ful', 'amount', 'acount', 'reported', 'day', 'late', 'xxxx', 'payment', 'owed', 'amount', 'colections', 'department', 'representative', 'tel', 'owed', 'paid', 'colections', 'department', 'representative', 'tel', 'acount', 'paid', 'next', 'due', 'date', 'xxxx', 'never', 'told', 'owed', 'course', 'would', 'paid', 'representative', 'told', 'owed', 'would', 'alowed', 'acount', 'go', 'day', 'late', 'absurd', 'course', 'would', 'paid', 'told', 'owed', 'caled', 'xxxx', 'pay', 'told', 'owed', 'show', 'imediately', 'made', 'payment', 'xxxx', 'would', 'paid', 'amount', 'xxxx', 'told', 'neded', 'start', 'telephone', 'cal', 'xx', 'informed', 'cal', 'would', 'recorded', 'locate', 'recording', 'wil', 'hear', 'exactly', 'colections', 'representative', 'told', 'severely', 'penalized', 'le', 'please', 'remove', 'late', 'report', 'due', 'miscomunication', 'owed', 'net', 'credit']",xx xx informed net credit payment history ben satisfactory day past due since begining payment history xx xx received email net credit stating owed xx xx xx xx xx xx caled net credit make xx xx payment transfered colections department informed representative wanted pay owed xx xx payment told owed aproved payment day xx xx paid exactly told owed ben told owed would paid end cal representative stated acount curent next payment due xx made payment xx xx xx received alert change credit report read nc financial flaged acount day past due bafled asert fuly due eror part net credit formaly requesting adjustment wil also submit request via consumer financial protection bureau imediately contacted xx xx xx sr compliance asociate via telephone conected voicemail left rather frantic mesage folowed email loged onto net credit acount mesage read payment due wednesday xx overdue please make payment son posible caled made xxxx payment xxxx paid told owed net credit colections department representative folowed another email xx xx xxxx time net credit online acount showed owed xxxx payment loged paid xxxx folowed xx xx xxxx finaly received response xxxx xx xx stated actualy owed xx stated since pay ful amount acount reported day late xxxx payment owed amount colections department representative tel owed paid colections department representative tel acount paid next due date xxxx never told owed course would paid representative told owed would alowed acount go day late absurd course would paid told owed caled xxxx pay told owed show imediately made payment xxxx would paid amount xxxx told neded start telephone cal xx informed cal would recorded locate recording wil hear exactly colections representative told severely penalized le please remove late report due miscomunication owed net credit
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX we completed a modification with Wells Fargo Bank, we were so excited about the modification that we did n't read the entire forms that were sent out for us to sign. In XX/XX/XXXX due to my wife illness we fell behind not quite XXXX months with our mortgage, we were trying to catch up always a month behind. We decided to try to get help by doing a debt consolidation loan to bring us us to date it would also help us to secure a refinance in the next 12 months. We found a company that would do the loan for us just as we were to sign the document a Title search was done and we found out that HUD had placed a partial claim on the home making it virtually impossible to secure a loan. The claim shows up as a lien on the home. Finding this out was a shock to us, we were never informed verbally that a lien would be placed on the home by HUD. This has create a hardship for us because no one will touch our home due to this XXXX lien. We are falling farther behind on our mortgage and other bills we want to save our home, as we have the income to maintain our home once we get someone to help us to get ahead. We sincerely hope you can help.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I made a promotional purchase for 24 month interest free. The purchase was on XX/XX/2016 for {$1300.00}. Every payment I made I would make sure it was applied to my promotional balance, as I was repeatedly emailed the answer that the promotional balance was paid first. Because of the interest not being charged if paid before the promotion expired. I have every bill from when this account was created and almost every payment was not applied towards the promotional balance. Over {$2100.00} of on time payments were not credited towards my promotional balance. Now I have a court summons, which I will answer with and submit all this evidence. There is also a letter from Citi Bank / Best Buy stating there was fraud on my account of over {$500.00}, that was never resolved. They transferred the account to a new card, and more charges were added on to the bill. With no reference of the charges. Now the amount owed reached over {$3000.00}.

Student loan,"Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, my loans in repayment ( Loans 1 and 2 ) under the Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ) plan were moved from repayment to forbearance status without my knowledge or consent. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX representative XXXX confirmed that this was standard practice, despite the fact that XXXX previously assessed a payment under the PAYE plan towards Loans 1 and 2 on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon escalation, representative XXXX also informed me that this is standard practice and that XXXX ( my prior servicer ) essentially messed up and should have put me in forbearance instead of repayment. A XXXX  representative confirmed with me at approx.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","While reviewing my credit report, I saw multiple unauthorized credit inquiries displaying that I have no recognition or knowledge of. I made numerous means of contact via writing and by phone to all companies requesting to them to investigate the unauthorized inquiries and for them to contact the 3 Credit Bureaus to have them permanently delete/remove these inaccuracies from my credit report. I was informed over the phone that they have no way of getting those unauthorized inquiries deleted and for me to make direct contact to the credit bureaus to start the disputing process. Many of these companies, initially gave an issue with verifying any of my information because they wouldnt accept the given information found on my credit report, they wanted my full/ last four digits of my Social Security Number which I refused to provide due to my rights under the FCRA laws. I contacted Experian several times by via phone and mail requesting for these unauthorized inquires to be removed from my credit report because either them or any of these companies listed were unable to provide me with any signed statements or contracts to indicate the origin of this collection debt/inquiry, to resolve this matter, since I have never had any dealings at any of these companies at the date of these unauthorized inquiries. As you probably know, Credit Reporting Agencies treat inquiries as a statement of fact and will not allow a consumer to dispute them. Since it is against federal law ( Fair Credit Reporting Act -- 15 USC 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) for an entity to view a consumers credit report without a "" permissible purpose, '' so performing a "" hard inquiry '' on my credit file ( s ) without my permission is a willful violation of the law.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened a Commerce Bank secure credit card about one year ago with the recommendation from a local banker. And after having the card for about ten months, I went to the branch and asked whether it was possible for me to be given a regular credit card. The banker helped me to apply for the regular card, and promised to call me with any updates, which she never did. The application was rejected due to the reason that I am not a permanent resident. Even though I could understand the reasoning, and can accept this decision, Commerce Bank and their local employees did not at any point during this process informed me that the bank does not approve regular credit cards to non-resident, while knowing for a fact that I am not a XXXX citizen or a permanent resident. To be more specific, at the time of opening of the secured card, I asked them about the possibility for getting a regular credit card after opening the secured one for about a year, and the banker told me that it was possible, and when I went to the branch to apply for the regular card, the banker XXXX same one ) did not mention the fact that the regular card is not available for non-residents. I am not sure that if it is an actual break of law or any regulation, but I was under the wrong impression that getting a regular card was a possibility. I am not satisfied with the fact that Commerce Bank did not point out this rule, and this information is nowhere to be found on their website or the materials sent to me. 

The second part of the complaint is that after I learned that I was rejected the regular card, I asked the local branch to close my secure account, as there is no point to keep this useless card while paying for the {$49.00} annual fee. At first, I called the customer service, and the representative told me that I needed to go to the local branch to close the account, and that I might still be charged for the annual fee, because they would need 30 days to process this request ( I decided to close the account on XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). I just could not understand how is this even possible ( being charged for the annual fee even though I decided to close the account, and the fact that it takes 30 days to close the account ), but I followed their demand and went to the local branch to close the account. The banker submitted my request and told me that it usually takes less than 30 days for the process to be finished, and I should get my money back in about three weeks ( I have the recording of our conversation as I could not trust their words anymore ). 

I put in my request on XXXX/XXXX/2015, and the card, later I found out, was closed on XXXX/XXXX/2015. However, after waiting for over 30 days for my money to be put into my checking account with them, I still have not received it as of today XXXX/XXXX/2015. I tried to call them last week asking about this issue, and they promised to call me back, but they never did. Therefore, right now I would like to ask for help with getting my money back, since it has been well over 30 days, and since I need the money as soon as possible in order to pay my bills which are due next week. I seriously doubt that Commerce Bank will be willing to pay for any late fees and interests incurred with my bills, so I just would like to ask them to give my money back.",3,"['opened', 'comerce', 'bank', 'secure', 'credit', 'card', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'recomendation', 'local', 'banker', 'card', 'ten', 'month', 'went', 'branch', 'asked', 'whether', 'posible', 'given', 'regular', 'credit', 'card', 'banker', 'helped', 'aply', 'regular', 'card', 'promised', 'cal', 'update', 'never', 'aplication', 'rejected', 'due', 'reason', 'permanent', 'resident', 'even', 'though', 'could', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'acept', 'decision', 'comerce', 'bank', 'local', 'employes', 'point', 'proces', 'informed', 'bank', 'aprove', 'regular', 'credit', 'card', 'nonresident', 'knowing', 'fact', 'xx', 'citizen', 'permanent', 'resident', 'specific', 'time', 'opening', 'secured', 'card', 'asked', 'posibility', 'geting', 'regular', 'credit', 'card', 'opening', 'secured', 'one', 'year', 'banker', 'told', 'posible', 'went', 'branch', 'aply', 'regular', 'card', 'banker', 'xx', 'one', 'mention', 'fact', 'regular', 'card', 'available', 'nonresident', 'sure', 'actual', 'break', 'law', 'regulation', 'wrong', 'impresion', 'geting', 'regular', 'card', 'posibility', 'satisfied', 'fact', 'comerce', 'bank', 'point', 'rule', 'information', 'nowhere', 'found', 'website', 'material', 'sent', 'second', 'part', 'complaint', 'learned', 'rejected', 'regular', 'card', 'asked', 'local', 'branch', 'close', 'secure', 'acount', 'point', 'kep', 'useles', 'card', 'paying', 'anual', 'fe', 'first', 'caled', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'told', 'neded', 'go', 'local', 'branch', 'close', 'acount', 'might', 'stil', 'charged', 'anual', 'fe', 'would', 'ned', 'day', 'proces', 'request', 'decided', 'close', 'acount', 'xxxx', 'could', 'understand', 'even', 'posible', 'charged', 'anual', 'fe', 'even', 'though', 'decided', 'close', 'acount', 'fact', 'take', 'day', 'close', 'acount', 'folowed', 'demand', 'went', 'local', 'branch', 'close', 'acount', 'banker', 'submited', 'request', 'told', 'usualy', 'take', 'le', 'day', 'proces', 'finished', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'thre', 'weks', 'recording', 'conversation', 'could', 'trust', 'word', 'anymore', 'put', 'request', 'xxxx', 'card', 'later', 'found', 'closed', 'xxxx', 'however', 'waiting', 'day', 'money', 'put', 'checking', 'acount', 'stil', 'received', 'today', 'xxxx', 'tried', 'cal', 'last', 'wek', 'asking', 'isue', 'promised', 'cal', 'back', 'never', 'therefore', 'right', 'would', 'like', 'ask', 'help', 'geting', 'money', 'back', 'since', 'ben', 'wel', 'day', 'since', 'ned', 'money', 'son', 'posible', 'order', 'pay', 'bils', 'due', 'next', 'wek', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'comerce', 'bank', 'wil', 'wiling', 'pay', 'late', 'fe', 'interest', 'incured', 'bils', 'would', 'like', 'ask', 'give', 'money', 'back']",opened comerce bank secure credit card one year ago recomendation local banker card ten month went branch asked whether posible given regular credit card banker helped aply regular card promised cal update never aplication rejected due reason permanent resident even though could understand reasoning acept decision comerce bank local employes point proces informed bank aprove regular credit card nonresident knowing fact xx citizen permanent resident specific time opening secured card asked posibility geting regular credit card opening secured one year banker told posible went branch aply regular card banker xx one mention fact regular card available nonresident sure actual break law regulation wrong impresion geting regular card posibility satisfied fact comerce bank point rule information nowhere found website material sent second part complaint learned rejected regular card asked local branch close secure acount point kep useles card paying anual fe first caled customer service representative told neded go local branch close acount might stil charged anual fe would ned day proces request decided close acount xxxx could understand even posible charged anual fe even though decided close acount fact take day close acount folowed demand went local branch close acount banker submited request told usualy take le day proces finished get money back thre weks recording conversation could trust word anymore put request xxxx card later found closed xxxx however waiting day money put checking acount stil received today xxxx tried cal last wek asking isue promised cal back never therefore right would like ask help geting money back since ben wel day since ned money son posible order pay bils due next wek seriously doubt comerce bank wil wiling pay late fe interest incured bils would like ask give money back

Mortgage,"My loan was originated under XXXX XXXX who I believe worked for both Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems , Inc. ( MERS_ as Mortgagee , MERS is the nominee for Lender and the mortgage  loan originators post office address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MA XXXX and license number is XXXX. I was approved for a FHA loan with an adjustable rate mortgage. I used an attorney provided by XXXX XXXX, Guaranteed Rate or MERS, it was very unclear to me. The loan was originated under XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX in order for the investors or holders of the loan to avoid tax liability in the event they had to foreclose on the property. Additionally, I believe they are defrauding the US government by double dipping with loan write offs post foreclosure. In my case that sum was greater than 80K USD. Additionally, I was informed the loan was not tied to my SSN which is why I am still liable for the tax liens. If you read the XXXX XXXX XXXX agreement it seems very clear to me as a consumer they were responsible for the taxes. Please review all of the attached documents. I also submitted my complaint to the FBI, and have started to send the information out to private attorneys. I would think a FHA loan would have been tied to my SSN as the loan appeared on my credit report. I also notified XXXX XXXX who I had been making payments to that I needed help. I applied for a loan modification and was denied under the basis of the loan not being 12 months old. It's my understanding after briefly doing research the 12 month period is invalid and I should have been awarded a loan modification which would have prevented me from losing my home. I have been homeless since the foreclosure and have suffered emotional distress, damages, and have lost time which is of course the most valuable resource. I'd also like to point out I've never been married, and was hospitalized during the notices.

Debt collection,"Date : XX/XX/XXXX To : Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Re : EverBank loan # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, FL. XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA. XXXX Dear Processor, 1- We ( me and my husband ) filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX, and was confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX, and a plan was established for the payments to be made to the creditors. 2- One of the creditors was/is EverBank ( EB ), and since the said property was a rental at that time, the judge ordered the mortgage payments that were skipped during the BK filing, to be paid back in full. Hence, we made the past due payments accordingly in the amount of {$46000.00} ( see Exh. # 1 ). 3- Since the said loan was modified, the judge decided that the mortgage payments of this loan ( we had several mortgages that were modified to fit the BK plan, except the said loan ) to be paid according to the modification terms.
4- We had also a secured credit line with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was modified by the BK court to be paid over ten years with fixed monthly payments. 5- The attorney representing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the credit line holder ), refused to approve the BK courts payment plan, unless we pay back and bring current whatever we owe to EverBank ( see Exhibit # 2 ) 6- On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an Escrow payment analysis from EverBank telling us also how much our payments would be. We Paid the Mortgage payment via phone, and got confirmation # of XXXX ( see Exh. # 3 ). 
7- Prior to the final confirmation of the BK courts payment plan in XX/XX/XXXX ), EBs attorney requested additional past due amounts ( for five months ) to finalize the plan. We sent a cashiers check in the amount of {$15000.00}, and an additional monthly payment of {$2800.00} ( see exh. # 4 ) 8- On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a new mortgage statement ( Exh # 5 ), requesting in addition to the mortgage payment of {$3100.00} a lump sum payment of {$23000.00} of which {$1300.00} goes to fees + charges, and totaling {$26000.00} 9- We immediately contacted our BK attorney questioning this {$23000.00}. According to him we were not supposed to owe EB any arrearage. 10-For more than 18 months, EverBank refused to talk to us in regard this past due amount that we owe them, claiming that this is a BK case, and we must tell our BK attorney to contact them, and they will resolve it with him. 11-Eventually, and after about two years, they accepted to communicate with us, and assigned a customer relationship manager -XXXX XXXX-to handle the case. We send the above-mentioned evidence to her, and requested from her to pin point the months that we were delinquent so that we can compare them with our records, and if we were delinquent, then we will pay that amount we owe them. They claimed that it should be reflected on our monthly mortgage statements. I am attaching here several mortgage statements, and our bank statements that shows we paid all their mentioned delinquent months ( see exh. # 6 ) 12-We have been making the regular mortgage payments till XX/XX/XXXX, and our last 2 mortgage payments ( XX/XX/XXXX + XX/XX/XXXX see Exh. # 7 ) ) were returned to us, claiming that we are supposed to pay back the whole delinquent amount that was increased to about {$30000.00}. 13-For about 3 months, we kept going back and forth with no avail, and they filed Notice of Default and started the foreclosure process in XX/XX/XXXX. For the next 4 months, we continued to discuss our case with EB, and most of the time either the relationship manager was no longer with EB, or a new one was appointed to our case, which made us repeat the scenario more than 8 times ( we have changed round 8 relationship managers and here are their names-XXXX XXXX- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Eventually one of them suggested to apply for loan modification ( which my husband refused to do, and argued with them saying that we made your regular payments for 28 months, and we can continue making the same payments, why then we should modify the loan, since we have only 18 yrs to pay it off ).
14-Eventually, I agreed to apply for loan modification, for which we were eligible, but they denied the modification without a solid or legitimate reason, we appealed the denial, and filed again proving to them that they made a big mistake in calculating our income, our second application was denied also claiming also that there were missing docs, and every time they requested a document was sent to them immediately, then another relationship manager comes, and claims that there are missing docs. ( see EXH # 8 & 9- We can send you the modification application if necessary ).
XX/XX/XXXX, my husband sold one of his properties, and when he received the payoff demand from the servicer ( XXXX ), he noticed that, the payoff amount is about {$90000.00} more than the original loan amount. He contacted the BK attorney questioning about the figures, the attorney told him that XXXX DID NOT ADHERE TO OR COMPLY with the BK approved plan, and they ( XXXX ) went by their own books, and he sent the court dockets that showed what was the agreement between each lender and us. 15-According to the agreement ( see Exh. # 10 ) EverBank was supposed to request a payment of {$350.00} ( for 60 months ) in addition to the regular mortgage payments, and not {$26000.00}. They didnt honor the court decision, and their own attorneys agreement. 16-If you calculate the pre-petition amount of {$20000.00}, and the post-petition amount of {$18000.00}, and compare that with the amounts in ( Exh. # 1 ) that we paid to EB add to that an escrow surplus in the amount of approximately {$5200.00} that they owe us you will notice that we even overpaid them, cause as I indicated previously, the attorney for the credit line didnt agree to the BK payment plan, unless the delinquent amounts to EB were satisfied.
At this time, I am seeking your assistance in this mater, by negotiating a favorable deal and payment plan with EverBank or XXXX, and keep the house which is scheduled to foreclose in XX/XX/XXXX. Thank you in advance for your consideration and cooperation. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX.",6,"['date', 'xxxx', 'consumer', 'finance', 'protection', 'bureau', 'ever', 'bank', 'loan', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'fl', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx',

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, I am writing in regard to the failure of receiving my pricematch benefit from Citi 's  Price Rewind program. 

I contacted Citi 's customer service and provided my case number and spoke with a claims adjuster named XXXX on XX/XX/18 at XXXX XXXX est. She told me my timestamped screenshot of the advertisement was not valid and could not substantiated at the store. This was a clear tactic Citi uses because I was familiar with their usual runarounds in trying to deny my previous claims with correct and valid documentation. 

To provide greater background, I have had the same issue with the Citi Price Rewind program last year to the month coincidentally and they provided the same baseless reasons in order to deny my claim by providing false details and interpreting their clear-cut terms and conditions in a fickle manner. The claims were eventually approved through CFPB as did my all my other claims from other times using this type of advertisement. 

XXXX promised me she would call me back that night and does not but eventually does on the following day at XXXX est on XX/XX/18 at a time I explicitly told her I would be busy at work. 

In the call she reiterates that she verified with the store and provides me with a current XX/XX/18 current item pricing to which I doubt because I verified with the store and the information I received conflicts with what I received from XXXX. Additionally, the information she provides is irrelevant because I am not submitting an advertisement for XX/XX/18 but in fact it was dated on XX/XX/18 and this information was valid and in stock at the time. Eventually later on XX/XX/18 a supervisor named XXXX informs me that they are standing by their original claim denial decision.

Bank account or service,"I was adviaed via email that my deceased mother 's account had been dormant for too long. So I contacted Capital One and advised them that my mother was deceased and that I had been the personal representative of her estate. However I had administered her estate and all if her assets had been distributed before I became aware that this banking account existed. By the time i became aware of the Capital One account, the estate had been discharged. I was advised to provide them a court order reflecting that I was in fact the personal representative, a copy of her death certificate and a direction to pay letter advising how I wanted the funds distributed. I provided all three. I specificlly requested that they issue the check to me as there was no longer an estate. At no time would Capital One disclose either the account number or the amount of funds contained within it. A week later I recieved a call advising my request was denied because they would not issue the check to me without a "" Small Estate Affidavit '' and another direction to pay letter. At that time I advised them that Florida, the state of my mother 's residence and closed estate, did not recognize a Small Estate Affidavit. I was told the check would not be released to me without one, so I prepared a notarized "" Small Estate Form '' and a new Direction to Pay letter requesting the funds be sent to me as the personal representative and heir of my mother 's estate. On XX/XX/2016, I received a call from Capital One advising they did not need any further documents and they would be releasing the funds in a check made out to the estate of my mother. When I called Capital One to straighten this out, I was transferred to a XXXX who told me that that was all Capital One could/would do. When I asked XXXX why I had been made to submit the extra documents, he told me that the Small Estate Affidavit was not recognized in Florida. I told him that i had pointed this out to his predecessor during my previous conversation but they had insisted I provide one. XXXX then placed me on hold to speak with someone and came back to tell me there was nothing Capital One could/would do. When i asked to be transfered to his supervisor he advised me he was the highest telephonic individual I could speak with. When I asked for his last name or some reference number for him, XXXX told me that was confidential. When I asked to speak whoever he was speaking with when he placed me on hold, he once again told me that person was confidential and refused go transfer the call. Finally when i asked where I could write someone at Capital One, he told me the only thing I could do was fill out a customer satisfaction form. This process is absurd. Capital One has been provided with all the documentation they requested and even more documentation above and beyond that described on their settlement page of their website. I have provided a notarized affidavit and court order demonstrating that I was both the personal representative and heir of my mother and Capital One has repeatedly refused to acknowledge my standing in this matter. Capital One 's actions will cause prolonged and expensive litigation to release finds which Capital One has no right to retain.",9,"['adviaed', 'via', 'email', 'deceased', 'mother', 'acount', 'ben',

Mortgage,"We have a chapter XXXX case going, our mortgage arrears are included in our chapter XXXX we are paying our chapter XXXX every 2 weeks on time. PNC is our mortgage company, I find out information by calling not by notices. My XXXX complaint- they do n't send notices! We were approved for a reduced principal modification back in XXXX, showing our XXXX payment due on XXXX XXXX, 2015. We sent all the paperwork back by the end of XXXX as requested, we signed and had the paperwork notarized. I had n't received any payment books or papers stating completion by the end of XXXX, so I called PNC to find out that the modification could n't be completed due to PNC wanting a motion from the bankruptcy judge approving the modification. I had no paperwork, or calls regarding this issue. I found out due to calling in to PNC. I talked with our attorney for bankruptcy and they were able to get the motion heard XXXX weeks later. Our attorney advised us that the judge will not rule on the motion due to the ruling being unnecessary. Our home is not included in the bankruptcy, only the arrearage. So I have n't heard from PNC, and we were planning on making our XXXX XXXX payment, I still have n't had any correspondence from PNC. I called yesterday XXXX/XXXX/2015 and found out that our modification was thrown out due to the judge denying the motion as unnecessary. I will attach the judges decision. I spoke with a person in the bankruptcy department for PNC and she stated that the denial due to it being unnecessary should n't go against us for the modification. I was asked to send in the letter our attorneys sent us stating that as expected the judge denied the motion as unnecessary. I called PNC today to verify and faxes take XXXX days to upload, the person in loss mitigation did say he would send an email to the closing department to see if they can get our modification reactivated. I was asked to call back on Friday afternoon.

Student loan,"My loan was transferred from Mohela to  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX . I always question why at Mohela my principal would never go down even when I paid upto {$100.00} more? Then when it was transferred I had the same problem with  XXXX . I made several inquires but was told that interest was satisfied first they would go around and around about I have a 25 year loan and I must pay fro 25 years. I told them that this was a simple interest loan and why was the overage in my payments going to principal? They told me they just pay ahead interest because it is a 25 year loan. They do this to all student loans. This is not right as all student loans are simple interest as with mine as they must follow certain guidelines set forth by the Department of education. As with my loan it states I can pay as much as I want over the minimum payment and this will reduce the length of my loan as overage of my minimum payment will go to principal including no pre-payment penalty I believe this practice is on going with in both Mohela and  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  in fact I believe they train their customer service agents to convince all borrowers that all we can do is pay ahead  interest.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On  X/X/17    I called   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   @  XXXX  regarding a debt that they purchased from   XXXX   XXXX   and spoke with   XXXX   XXXX  . I stated that in no form or fashion that I am admitting to the debt that is trying to be collected, I am simply trying to make a settlement payment and not payment arrangements because it is not my debt but being reported on my credit report. The operations  manager stated (    XXXX   XXXX    ) th at this debt is in a non-collection status. He stated that in order for me to make a  one time  settlement payment I had to state that "" I was not disputing this debt ''. I stated on a recorded line that "" I am not admitting to this debt in no form or fashion and I am simply stating that I am willing to make a good faith payment for the account that is not mines to be removed '' .Even though   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   purchased the debt from   XXXX   XXXX  , when I contacted   XXXX   XXXX   they stated I do not ow the debt to them. I have nothing to do with this company purchase,   XXXX   XXXX   stated I do not owe the debt to them so I am disputing the debt with this company as debt that is not mines. This debt can not be validated with copies of statements there is NO CONTRACT/ AGREEMENT with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   FOR THE AMOUNT BEING STATED THAT IS OWED.   If the debt that is being reported in a non-collection status with the company that is reporting to the credit bureau then why is it being reported on my credit report and if this debt was not validated by the credit reporting agency then it should not be reported by the credit bureau. There was no contract sent to me that was signed by be from the credit bureau from the comp any (    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    stating that I owe money that was being reported as my debt ) on the credit report it states : Disputed, resolved, consumer disagrees. If this debt was resolved then why is the operati ons manager from    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   stating that it is in a "" non -collection '' status and the credit bureau is currently reporting it as my debt. You say that you have reinvestigated these accounts but youve admitted that all you have done is parroted information given to you by other sources and shifted the burden back to me to contact the original creditor to verify these accounts which is clearly in violati on of 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ).    I also asked you to give me the name of the person in your company who verified the accuracy of these accounts but you ignored this request as well which is another violati on of Federal Law and evi dence of your willful disregard of the law.   your company must be willing and able to produce a document in your files that proves th e account ( s ) in dispute belong to me and the information being reported is accurate and you must be able to do this in a court of law if I file a lawsuit against you. Someone in your company must authenticate the documents in your files that were used to verify the disputed accounts and to do this they must have 1st hand knowledge of the alleged account ( s ) and all that has ever transpired for the alleged account ( s ), under oath and under the penalty of perjury. As I am sure that you are well aware, current Federal case law states that, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from other sources. The Courts have also ordered that a Reinvestigation that merely shifts the burden back to the consumer and the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). You have ignored my request to provided me with the documents that you have in your files that you used to verify the disputed accounts which means that you have NOT verified or you can not verify any of these accounts and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me for negligent noncompliance ( Section 617 ) if you fail to comply with this Federal Law.",1,"['x', 'caled', 'xx', 'xx',

Credit card or prepaid card,"My problem is with XXXX. I have had a credit card with them for over 20 years. Last year they closed the store in XXXX XXXX where I live. Now there is no location convenient for my use. I therefore have not used the credit card. I did get an estimate for carpeting from XXXX about 3 months ago but the cost was too high and I purchased from someone else. 

There are very few times that I can now shop at XXXX and their on-line prices I have found to be too high. That is not the problem however. The problem is that I received a letter telling me that I either had to make a purchase by XX/XX/XXXX, or my credit limit would be lowered. 

The letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX, and states ; "" Thank you for being a valued XXXX cardmember! After a recent review of your account, we noticed that your XXXX card ( for the account number referenced above ) has been inactive for over 16 months.

Debt collection,"After having my service with XXXX suspended for several months after moving to a location I was unable to re-establish service, I ended up closing the account on X/X/15. The service had automatically resumed, even without any service equipment connected. I called and spoke with a representative and discussed options. We decided the best thing would be to close the account and pay the early termination fee and remaining balance. She credited one month as a courtesy and since only 1 day had passed in the current bill, that month was essentially refunded as well. This overall left me with a credit of {$130.00} on the account after paying the early termination fee. The account was closed on X/X/15 and a refund of the remaining balance was mailed to me on X/X/15. I have email confirmations showing both events.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Re : Acct # XXXX According to Navient and another collection agency called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am indebted to them in the amount of {$11000.00}. I have on numerous letters requested validity of their claim. All that l have been receiving spreadsheets with numbers on them. I have reached out to all 3 Credit Reporting Agencies, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Navient on numerous letters ( Please see attached letters and their responses from Navient ) have FAILED to honor my request. 

I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged debt, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known to Navient any debt claim must be pursued for collection in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection regulations associated with said claim to include but not limited to the FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, Navient has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitant to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim by Navient and I call on the CFPB to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requires to be dismissed in full.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a call at my business saying that it was the gas company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They said that I had an overdue balance of {$490.00} and that I had to pay it immediately or my gas service would be disconnected, and my business depends 100 % on gas. They told me to purchase a prepaid card with the amount due on it ( {$490.00} ), and that when I got it they would give me instructions on how to give them the card information in order to avoid having my gas service disconnected. And I did so. I purchased a card called Reloadit with the amount off {$490.00} on it from the XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX. But a few hours later I realized that the gas companys ( XXXX XXXX ) offices arent open on Saturdays, and that I had been a victim of fraud. 
I called Reloadit to see if I could cancel the payment process to the person who defrauded me, and it appeared that I had called in time to cancel the payment. 
The Reloadit representatives gave me a case confirmation number : XXXX. 
Three days later, a woman named XXXX called me from XXXX to give me a new incident number : XXXX. 
Since they hadnt called me back on XXXX XXXX, I called them again, and the representative XXXX gave me another case number ( XXXX ) and told me to send them the proof of purchase for the Reloadit card, plus a copy of the card with the numbers on the back of the card. She told me to send it by fax to XXXX, and I did so. 
They told me that it would take approximately one month to have my money returned. 
On XXXX XXXX I spoke with a man named XXXX, who gave me another case number ( XXXX ). And so it went : month after month I was assisted by different representatives who gave me different case numbers, telling me they were reopening the case, but they never gave me a solution or sent me the money. Ive already spoken with the manager and he hasnt given me the solution for getting back my money either. 

A few months ago I told them that if they didnt send the money, I was going to report them, either to the Better Business Bureau or the CFPB. 
Apparently they dont care. Ive given them several more months, and I still havent received anything. Please help me.

Debt collection,"After leaving school & subsequently defaulting on my student loans 10 years ago, I recently sought to begin repaying my student debt. Per ed.gov website instructions I contacted student loan manager at the school holding the debt on my Federal Perkins Loan, who then referred me to the collection agency now responsible for resolving the [ XXXX XXXX ] debt. The collection agency in charge of my Perkins Loan insisted that in order to resolve the Perkins Loan [ {$7600.00} ] debt I must "" Consolidate '' all of my [ other ] outstanding defaulted student loans with them. I declined and specifically requested to "" Rehabilitate '' only my defaulted Perkins Loan with this agency now in charge of the Perkins Loan debt. The collection agency refused to offer me "" Rehabilitation '' on my Perkins Loan at all, and again insisted that my only option was to "" Consolidate '' the debt. I declined, and that was the end of the conversation. 

Immediately following that phone conversation I emailed the student loan manager at the school and advised her of my concerns that the collection agency was being less than honest about my repayment options, she advised me that although the agent I spoke to was incorrect about my option to "" Rehab '' the loan, the agency was trustworthy. 

One day later the collection agency called me back and I was advised that in order to "" Rehab '' my Perkins Loan I must accept a minimum payment of $ XXXX/month. I declined again as I simply can not afford that payment. 

Again I immediately contacted ( by email ) the student loan manager at the school explaining that I have been out of work for an extended period of time and I can not afford such a high payment, and requested an appeal or other process to reduce what I am being told is a mandatory minimum payment to "" Rehabilitate '' the Loan. The student loan manager emailed me back stating that the collection agency is correct, the minimum payment possible in order to "" Rehab '' my Perkins Loan is $ XXXX/mo. 

I researched the issue of repaying defaulted Perkins Loans on the Dept. of Education website here : XXXX ( page XXXX-XXXX ) and found that the DOE requires schools to offer repayment of defaulted Perkins Loans "" sufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance on the loan within a 10-year repayment period. '' This was directly contradicted to me several times in email & phone conversations that I had with both the collection agency and the university student loan manager. 

Further more, on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website "" Repay Student Debt '' page here : XXXX it states that defaulted Federal Student Loan borrowers `` have the right to set your payments based on how much money you make. Your payments can be as low as {$5.00} per month if you are unemployed or have very little income. Your debt collector is required by law to offer you this income-driven rehabilitation payment plan. '' I realize this ( $ XXXX/month ) policy may not be specific to Perkins Loans. 

My complaint is that a ) the collection agency has been intentionally dishonest regarding my repayment options ; b ) both the collection agency and the university 's student loan manager continue to insist to me, on the phone & by email, that my minimum "" Rehabilitation '' payment must be significantly larger than that indicated by the DOE 's published regulations regarding defaulted Perkins Loans, despite knowing that such payments would cause significant "" hardship for the borrower '' [ me ], and in direct contravention of the DOE guidelines ( see XXXX page XXXX-XXXX ).",6,"['leaving',

Vehicle loan or lease,XX/XX/2018 : Applied for a Used Auto Loan. Loan Amount Requested : {$33000.00}. Loan was denied for Excessive obligations in relation to income ( overextended ). The lender was notified that 2 other auto loans were recently paid off. These same loans were being considered when analyzing capacity to repay. Lender was notified of this. There was no response to this inquiry.

Debt collection,"I contracted XXXX services in my residence through XXXX XXXX back in XXXX. For installation services, they claim they sent me an invoice for XXXX {$49.00} by mail. I never received such invoice. I receive several bills by mail and never failed in promptly paying any bill I received. As a customer of XXXX, I requested, in at least XXXX occasion, support services from XXXX during the period I had XXXX in my apartment. Support services were provided normally and no debt was ever mentioned. If I was in debt with the company and they had that in their system, why is it that I requested a service and the service was rendered without ever mentioning any debt? 
Now, 6 months after I canceled XXXX services, and more than one year after the installatoion date in XXXX, an open collection account with XXXX is showing in my credit report. I chatted with a representative of the company and they told me the invoice was sent in XXXX ( the XXXX I never received ). XXXX has always had my address, e-mail address, phone number and, more importantly, a valid credit card on file. Why is it that they never sent me any communication, verbal or written, that I had an active debt of XXXX {$49.00} so I could pay for it. Why have they never charged my credit card they had on file for the XXXX {$49.00}. Why have n't they refused to offer me support service if I had an open debt with them? When I asked their customer service representative, the only answer I got is that an invoice was sent to me, once, in XXXX. And with that, they assumed I was a bad payer ( even knowing that I paid all XXXX monthly fees on time for the 7 months I had the service. This is absurd. 
They sent my debt for collection to ATG Credit. After chatting with XXXX 's customer service representative, I then immediately called ATG Credit and paid for the pending XXXX {$49.00}. I also queried ATG 's customer service representative about their having to notify me before hitting my credit file with an open collection account. They claim they also sent me a letter. I never got this either. I honestly doubt any letter was sent. Again, I would never ignore or fail paying any open debt I knew I had. I have virtually no debt. I carry no credit card balances ( I pay all balances monthly ) and have XXXX leases I pay religiously every month. 
After the collections account was sent to Equifax, my credit was hit by XXXX points because of that. This is not fair. I can not pay a debt I never knew I had. 
Now I am shopping for a home and was looking for alternatives to get a mortgage. These XXXX points can considerably increase the financial cost of a mortgage loan.",6,"['contracted', 'xx', 'service', 'residence', 'xx', 'xx', 'back', 'xx', 'instalation', 'service', 'claim', 'sent', 'invoice', 'xx', 'mail', 'never', 'received', 'invoice', 'receive', 'several', 'bils', 'mail', 'never', 'failed', 'promptly', 'paying', 'bil', 'received', 'customer', 'xx', 'requested', 'least', 'xx', 'ocasion', 'suport', 'service', 'xx', 'period', 'xx', 'apartment', 'suport', 'service', 'provided', 'normaly', 'debt', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'debt', 'company', 'system', 'requested', 'service', 'service', 'rendered', 'without', 'ever', 'mentioning', 'debt', 'month', 'canceled', 'xx', 'service', 'one', 'year', 'instalatoion', 'date', 'xx', 'open', 'colection', 'acount', 'xx', 'showing', 'credit', 'report', 'chated', 'representative', 'company', 'told', 'invoice', 'sent', 'xx', 'xx', 'never', 'received', 'xx', 'always', 'adres', 'email', 'adres', 'phone', 'number', 'importantly', 'valid', 'credit', 'card', 'file', 'never', 'sent', 'comunication', 'verbal', 'writen', 'active', 'debt', 'xx', 'could', 'pay', 'never', 'charged', 'credit', 'card', 'file', 'xx', 'nt', 'refused', 'ofer', 'suport', 'service', 'open', 'debt', 'asked', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'answer', 'got', 'invoice', 'sent', 'xx', 'asumed', 'bad', 'payer', 'even', 'knowing', 'paid', 'al', 'xx', 'monthly', 'fe', 'time', 'month', 'service', 'absurd', 'sent', 'debt', 'colection', 'atg', 'credit', 'chating', 'xx', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'imediately', 'caled', 'atg', 'credit', 'paid', 'pending', 'xx', 'also', 'queried', 'atg', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'notify', 'hiting', 'credit', 'file', 'open', 'colection', 'acount', 'claim', 'also', 'sent', 'leter', 'never', 'got', 'either', 'honestly', 'doubt', 'leter', 'sent', 'would', 'never', 'ignore', 'fail', 'paying', 'open', 'debt', 'knew', 'virtualy', 'debt', 'cary', 'credit', 'card', 'balance', 'pay', 'al', 'balance', 'monthly', 'xx', 'lease', 'pay', 'religiously', 'every', 'month', 'colections', 'acount', 'sent', 'equifax', 'credit', 'hit', 'xx', 'point', 'fair', 'pay', 'debt', 'never', 'knew', 'shoping', 'home', 'loking', 'alternative', 'get', 'mortgage', 'xx', 'point', 'considerably', 'increase', 'financial', 'cost', 'mortgage', 'loan']",contracted xx service residence xx xx back xx instalation service claim sent invoice xx mail never received invoice receive several bils mail never failed promptly paying bil received customer xx requested least xx ocasion suport service xx period xx apartment suport service provided normaly debt ever mentioned debt company system requested service service rendered without ever mentioning debt month canceled xx service one year instalatoion date xx open colection acount xx showing credit report chated representative company told invoice sent xx xx never received xx always adres email adres phone number importantly valid credit card file never sent comunication verbal writen active debt xx could pay never charged credit card file xx nt refused ofer suport service open debt asked customer service representative answer got invoice sent xx asumed bad payer even knowing paid al xx monthly fe time month service absurd sent debt colection atg credit chating xx customer service representative imediately caled atg credit paid pending xx also queried atg customer service representative notify hiting credit file open colection acount claim also sent leter never got either honestly doubt leter sent would never ignore fail paying open debt knew virtualy debt cary credit card balance pay al balance monthly xx lease pay religiously every month colections acount sent equifax credit hit xx point fair pay debt never knew shoping home loking alternative get mortgage xx point considerably increase financial cost mortgage loan

Mortgage,"My mortgage was sold by XXXX to Loancare LLC on XXXX XXXX, 2015. My mortgage payment was due on XXXX XXXX. I submitted a payment to XXXX electronically on the XXXX, not understanding that it would n't go through, and in fact I was given a confirmation number as receipt of payment. A week later I checked my bank account and no funds had been taken out of my account. XXXX 's website now said that my loan had been sold and gave me an incorrect customer service number for Loancare XXXX. After finding the correct number ( and calling XXXX to let them know the number on both their website and customer service line was incorrect, ) I spoke with Loancare who informed me that my payment had not been processed and was now late. I was informed by Customer Service that there were no late fees associated with it - in fact that no late fees could be associated with my account for 60 days after the sale - however, there is a one time payment fee on a sliding scale depending on how late your payment is. For payments 1-4 days after the due date there is no fee, 5-9 days is a {$5.00} fee and 10 days or more is a {$10.00} fee. They say this is a one-time draft fee and not a late fee, although I 'm at a loss to understand how this is n't a late fee in disquise. I made the payment to Loancare electronically - including the additional {$5.00} fee - because I wanted to make sure my account is up to date and I feared racking up any additional "" fees.

Debt collection,"I was recently made aware of a debt that I may owe to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$78.00}. This debt was related to a deposit account I had with this organization. I noticed the debt reporting to my credit files and disputed the information. I was quickly advised in writing from XXXX XXXX of this debt. I made a call to XXXX XXXX this morning XXXX/XXXX/2016 to advise them of my intention to pay this debt for {$78.00}. They had advised me this account was placed with a company called Monterey Financial based out of California. 

I contacted Monterey Financial when they opened this morning ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and was advised for my account number with them and that my balance is not {$78.00} but {$120.00}. I argued stating that XXXX states it to be {$78.00} and that is what they are reporting. They stated that the account was placed with them for collections over 3 years ago. They had very old contact information and had no way of getting in touch with me. They stated they last attempted to reach me on XXXX/XXXX/2016 with no luck as again the information they had was almost XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

After going back and forth with their Agent XXXX XXXX XXXX. I decided I was getting no where. So I contacted XXXX again and they informed me that anything they would be charging would be their fees or accumulated interest on my original debt. 

To the best of my knowledge the FDCPA expressly forbids this. As a consumer I am not required to pay any unauthorized charges such as interest rates, fees, or other charges. XXXX also advised me on this call that only the amount of {$78.00} would be sent to them. I called back Monterey Financial and they advised me that the total amount of interest was billed at XXXX cents/day. This brought my balance to {$100.00} and they were charging a {$20.00} processing fee to handle my payment. They also advised me that they total amount of {$100.00} would be sent to XXXX and they only collect the {$20.00} for the payment fee. 

As far as I can tell I am paying an unlawful 10 % interest on a {$78.00} debt to capcom fcu and an unlawful {$20.00} payment processing fee to Monterey Financial. 

I made this payment because I am attempting get approved for a mortgage and was advised this could potentially hinder me.

Debt collection,"I received a letter of a debt owed to Lloyd & McDaniel. so I called to see what was the best route to go to repay the debt ( that I 'm still not a hundred percent sure how I got it ). We agreed that I would pay hundred dollars on the XXXX of each month until the total amount was paid. After making the first payment I got a call from human resource at my job about a garnishment from this same company. Thinking there was a mistake I called Lloyd & McDaniel the debt collector to clear the issue up. After being called a liar for fifteen minutes and being reminded that all calls are recorded which I found funny because if they listen to the previous call it would have cleared up this whole situation so I decided to end the call and try back later.

I felt that Veteran 's United was deciding to 'walk back ' on decisions they had made, and when I inquired about this, requesting to work with another loan officer, the pre-approval I had earlier been offered was verbally withdrawn and indeed they did 'walk back ' on decisions which were made solely on information stemming from my income and employment history.

This is now resulting in showing over {$7000.00} of unapplied payments, but the mortgage now shows past due since XXXX XXXX, 2016. I did contact the provider by email and by phone several times. They have assured me the are reviewing the account. Beside a simple acknowledgement that they received my complaint and are reviewing this ( without any results as of XXXX/XXXX/16 ), they have never proactively reached out to me as to provide any status update. They are however reaching out with never ending collection calls and letter. If it was any other service, as a consumer, it would have swapped providers. However with a mortgage that is not such a simple task. It has been over 8 weeks with no results ( and I 'm sure I 'm not the only one ). I understand system issues, but it is inconceivable to me that not a single individual within the company can review my account and make the necessary corrections. I have no faith in the process, nor would I ever know if after the corrections the remaining balance would be correct ( depending on how payments are posted ).",0,"['ditech', 'mortgage', 'provider', 'went', 'system', 'upgrade', 'xx', 'acording', 'curently', 'make', 'biwekly', 'payment', 'mortgage', 'almost', 'twice', 'amount', 'standard', 'payment', 'due', 'technical', 'isues', 'system', 'longer', 'able', 'post', 'biwekly', 'payment', 'resulting', 'showing', 'unaplied', 'payment', 'mortgage', 'show', 'past', 'due', 'since', 'xx', 'xx', 'contact', 'provider', 'email', 'phone', 'several', 'time', 'asured', 'reviewing', 'acount', 'beside', 'simple', 'acknowledgement', 'received', 'complaint', 'reviewing', 'without', 'result', 'xxxx', 'never', 'proactively', 'reached', 'provide', 'status', 'update', 'however', 'reaching', 'never', 'ending', 'colection', 'cals', 'leter', 'service', 'consumer', 'would', 'swaped', 'provider', 'however', 'mortgage', 'simple', 'task', 'ben', 'weks', 'result', 'sure', 'one', 'understand', 'system', 'isues', 'inconceivable', 'single', 'individual', 'within', 'company', 'review', 'acount', 'make', 'necesary', 'corections', 'faith', 'proces', 'would', 'ever', 'know', 'corections', 'remaing', 'balance', 'would', 'corect', 'depending', 'payment', 'posted']",ditech mortgage provider went system upgrade xx acording curently make biwekly payment mortgage almost twice amount standard payment due technical isues system longer able post biwekly payment resulting showing unaplied payment mortgage show past due since xx xx contact provider email phone several time asured reviewing acount beside simple acknowledgement received complaint reviewing without result xxxx never proactively reached provide status update however reaching never ending colection cals leter service consumer would swaped provider however mortgage simple task ben weks result sure one understand system isues inconceivable single individual within company review acount make necesary corections faith proces would ever know corections remaing balance would corect depending payment posted

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am submitting this complaint directly to you because CFPB has direct oversight over the Credit Reporting Agencies. XXXX, Transunion, and XXXX have allowed a charged-off account scheduled for automatic removal XX/XX/XXXX to remain on my credit report past the 7-year deadline governed by FCRA 605. XXXX XXXX  XXXX unlawfully re-aged this charged-off account # XXXX to estimated month and year of XX/XX/XXXX. 
This debt is from my XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, opened XXXX, expiration date XX/XX/XXXX. The charged-off and closed date of the account is documented on my credit report as XX/XX/XXXX. I am aware that XXXX as the original creditor does not appear once the account is charged-off and closed because the debt was sold to a collection agency. XXXX XXXX  XXXX is the new debt owner. I made some payments to XXXX. This payment activity does not constitute a new debt and change the original charge-off date by the original lender. It is incontestably a continuation of the original debt. Federal law requires collection agencies to carry over the original delinquency date so that any collection account is deleted at the same time of the 7-year period charged-off account. It is a violation of law for a collection agency to report and treat a charged-off and closed account as newer. XXXX added a second charge off date of XX/XX/XXXX to make the charge-off appear more recent. In XXXX, I disputed this information with Transunion via phone, stating XXXX intentional re-aging this account and referred to the original creditors charged-off date of XX/XX/XXXX listed on my credit report. Transunion contacted XXXX and XXXX verified the information. I made an additional call back to Transunion to rebut the verified information and again referred to the original charge-off date of XX/XX/XXXX. Transunion advised me that only the creditor could remove this from my report. FCRA 605 holds the Credit Reporting Agencies and the creditors responsible for complying with the law, but that law has been defiled. I do not intend to engage more of my time with the other two reporting agencies while my credit report continues to be damaged, knowing my efforts would generate the same result as with Transunion. I do not intend to engage any time with XXXX XXXX XXXX because of the they have recertified outright deceptive information as of XX/XX/XXXX. Further, XXXX XXXX   XXXX is reporting a second charged off date of XX/XX/XXXX. This malicious, illegal reporting has caused me immeasurable injury. 

American consumers deserve to be protected by the FCRA 605 law, and should not have to deal with the irresponsible reporting concomitant with automatic removal of charged-off and closed accounts. Creditors should be prohibited from submitting re-aged information to the CRAs that extends the 7-year period. Per FCRA 605. Requirements relating to information contained in consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c ] ( a ) Information excluded from consumer reports. Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) of this section, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : ( 4 ) Accounts placed for collection or charged to profit and loss which antedate the report by more than seven years. ( c ) Running of Reporting Period ( 1 ) In general.The 7-year period referred to in paragraphs ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) of subsection ( a ) shall begin, with respect to any delinquent account that is placed for collection ( internally or by referral to a third party, whichever is earlier ), charged to profit and loss, or subjected to any similar action, upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the commencement of the delinquency which immediately preceded the collection activity, charge to profit and loss, or similar action.",1,"['submiting', 'complaint', 'directly', 'cfpb',

Debt collection,Cavarly Portfolio Services sued me whereI did not live or sign for the debt after they bought it from a bad debt list the original creditor wrote the debt off and the first collection agency XXXX wrote it off in bankruptcy. I became aware of this when I served both the default judgement and the notice of hearing at the same time in XX/XX/XXXX. I made my last payment on the car in XX/XX/XXXX. I did n't know I could sue at this time and so I did nothing. Since they have had the default judgment they have violated my FDCPA an additional three times. They seized all of my mothers social security funds from her bank account around {$900.00} in order to get it back she had to pay around {$150.00} to get an attorney to fix it. Cavarly claimed because my name was listed as payable upon death that they thought the account was mine even though the XXXX XXXX XXXX advised them otherwise. Then later on I had a account at XXXX XXXX XXXX one day it was just negative {$50.00} because they had seized all of my direct deposit paycheck from the day before and the bank charged me for the transaction. Still unaware of my options without talking to an attorney I believed it was over with in XX/XX/XXXX when the scarlet letter I wore on my public records for my credit report listed with case number XXXX default civil judgement for {$7000.00} fell off my report. No they were not done I sent them a letter regarding my rights under FDCPA and that they had violated several times. The statue of limitations had come and gone XXXX times. I advised them not to contact me or I would be sueing them for all of the violations. I received a generic letter from a new attorney in XX/XX/XXXX letting me know that they were taking over the collection of my debt from Cavarly. I am in the process of selling my home and the title is clouded something I was never served papers on even though all of the legal filings thus far had been in XXXX County where I had resided once temporarily for six months. I lived in XXXX County for two years when they say I was sewer served about lawsuit in XXXX County. However they filed the lein on my home in XXXX County of course not even that could be done without adding and inflating the amount of the judgement by {$7500.00} in interest they are claiming on a {$7000.00} debt that they were never intitled to collect on in the first place.,6,"['cavarly', 'portfolio', 'service', 'sued', 'live', 'sign', 'debt', 'bought', 'bad', 'debt', 'list', 'original', 'creditor', 'wrote', 'debt', 'first', 'colection', 'agency', 'xx', 'wrote', 'bankruptcy', 'became', 'aware', 'served', 'default', 'judgement', 'notice', 'hearing', 'time', 'xxxx', 'made', 'last', 'payment', 'car', 'xxxx', 'nt', 'know', 'could', 'sue', 'time', 'nothing', 'since', 'default', 'judgment', 'violated', 'fdcpa', 'aditional', 'thre', 'time', 'seized', 'al', 'mother', 'social', 'security', 'fund', 'bank', 'acount', 'around', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'pay', 'around', 'get', 'atorney', 'fix', 'cavarly', 'claimed', 'name', 'listed', 'payable', 'upon', 'death', 'thought', 'acount', 'mine', 'even', 'though', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'advised', 'otherwise', 'later', 'acount', 'xx', 'xx', 'xx', 'one', 'day', 'negative', 'seized', 'al', 'direct', 'deposit', 'paycheck', 'day', 'bank', 'charged', 'transaction', 'stil', 'unaware', 'option', 'without', 'talking', 'atorney', 'believed', 'xxxx', 'scarlet', 'leter', 'wore', 'public', 'record', 'credit', 'report', 'listed', 'case', 'number', 'xx', 'default', 'civil', 'judgement', 'fel', 'report', 'done', 'sent', 'leter', 'regarding', 'right', 'fdcpa', 'violated', 'several', 'time', 'statue', 'limitation', 'come', 'gone', 'xx', 'time', 'advised', 'contact', 'would', 'sueing', 'al', 'violation', 'received', 'generic', 'leter', 'new', 'atorney', 'xxxx', 'leting', 'know', 'taking', 'colection', 'debt', 'cavarly', 'proces', 'seling', 'home', 'title', 'clouded', 'something', 'never', 'served', 'paper', 'even', 'though', 'al', 'legal', 'filing', 'thus', 'far', 'ben', 'xx', 'county', 'resided', 'temporarily', 'six', 'month', 'lived', 'xx', 'county', 'two', 'year', 'say', 'sewer', 'served', 'lawsuit', 'xx', 'county', 'however', 'filed', 'lein', 'home', 'xx', 'county', 'course', 'even', 'could', 'done', 'without', 'ading', 'inflating', 'amount', 'judgement', 'interest', 'claiming', 'debt', 'never', 'intitled', 'colect', 'first', 'place']",cavarly portfolio service sued live sign debt bought bad debt list original creditor wrote debt first colection agency xx wrote bankruptcy became aware served default judgement notice hearing time xxxx made last payment car xxxx nt know could sue time nothing since default judgment violated fdcpa aditional thre time seized al mother social security fund bank acount around order get back pay around get atorney fix cavarly claimed name listed payable upon death thought acount mine even though xx xx xx advised otherwise later acount xx xx xx one day negative seized al direct deposit paycheck day bank charged transaction stil unaware option without talking atorney believed xxxx scarlet leter wore public record credit report listed case number xx default civil judgement fel report done sent leter regarding right fdcpa violated several time statue limitation come gone xx time advised contact would sueing al violation received generic leter new atorney xxxx leting know taking colection debt cavarly proces seling home title clouded something never served paper even though al legal filing thus far ben xx county resided temporarily six month lived xx county two year say sewer served lawsuit xx county however filed lein home xx county course even could done without ading inflating amount judgement interest claiming debt never intitled colect first place

Checking or savings account,"Around XX/XX/2017 I realized that someone I did not recognize sent money to my account, it was about between {$100.00} and {$200.00}. I am not sure when it started but as soon as I realized it I called my bank and asked them to return it as I do not know who it is coming from. I was told by my bank that there is nothing they could do on their end because they don't know who it was coming from being that it was a email or mobile transfer. The agent even joked saying its free money go ahead and spend it because there's nothing they could do about it. I was the agent to block whoever it is coming from so that the issue doesn't persist and to file a claim. After this I was under the impression that this issue was rectified not knowing that this person was still sending me money on a monthly basis totaling {$800.00} after a year. I was contacted by the claims department because someone filed a claim because they have been sending money to the wrong person. I explained what has been going on to the agent doing the claim and she said that she would contact me but none did. The bank went ahead and took {$800.00} out of my account leaving me overdraft without notifying me or getting permission. The agent noted that I gave her permission to take the money out because I do not know the sender and we did not have that conversation. after I told her the situation, I was told that she will contact me back. when I called multiple times they were rude and not trying to hear out the situation. The last lady informed me that I should have been aware of this and not spend the money and I called last year to file a fraud claim which was denied because I cant file a fraud claim for receiving money even if it is from someone I don't know. I told her that I wasn't aware that the claim got denied and I was not aware that this person was still putting money in my account in small amounts monthly, she insisted that I should have paid attention and not spend the money and hung up.",4,"['around', 'xx', 'realized', 'someone', 'recognize', 'sent', 'money', 'acount', 'betwen', 'sure', 'started', 'son', 'realized', 'caled', 'bank', 'asked', 'return', 'know', 'coming', 'told', 'bank', 'nothing', 'could', 'end', 'know', 'coming', 'email', 'mobile', 'transfer', 'agent', 'even', 'joked', 'saying', 'fre', 'money', 'go', 'ahead', 'spend', 'there', 'nothing', 'could', 'agent', 'block', 'whoever', 'coming', 'isue', 'persist', 'file', 'claim', 'impresion', 'isue', 'rectified', 'knowing', 'person', 'stil', 'sending', 'money', 'monthly', 'basis', 'totaling', 'year', 'contacted', 'claim', 'department', 'someone', 'filed', 'claim', 'ben', 'sending', 'money', 'wrong', 'person', 'explained', 'ben', 'going', 'agent', 'claim', 'said', 'would', 'contact', 'none', 'bank', 'went', 'ahead', 'tok', 'acount', 'leaving', 'overdraft', 'without', 'notifying', 'geting', 'permision', 'agent', 'noted', 'gave', 'permision', 'take', 'money', 'know', 'sender', 'conversation', 'told', 'situation', 'told', 'wil', 'contact', 'back', 'caled', 'multiple', 'time', 'rude', 'trying', 'hear', 'situation', 'last', 'lady', 'informed', 'ben', 'aware', 'spend', 'money', 'caled', 'last', 'year', 'file', 'fraud', 'claim', 'denied', 'cant', 'file', 'fraud', 'claim', 'receiving', 'money', 'even', 'someone', 'know', 'told', 'aware', 'claim', 'got', 'denied', 'aware', 'person', 'stil', 'puting', 'money', 'acount', 'smal', 'amount', 'monthly', 'insisted', 'paid', 'atention', 'spend', 'money', 'hung']",around xx realized someone recognize sent money acount betwen sure started son realized caled bank asked return know coming told bank nothing could end know coming email mobile transfer agent even joked saying fre money go ahead spend there nothing could agent block whoever coming isue persist file claim impresion isue rectified knowing person stil sending money monthly basis totaling year contacted claim department someone filed claim ben sending money wrong person explained ben going agent claim said would contact none bank went ahead tok acount leaving overdraft without notifying geting permision agent noted gave permision take money know sender conversation told situation told wil contact back caled multiple time rude trying hear situation last lady informed ben aware spend money caled last year file fraud claim denied cant file fraud claim receiving money even someone know told aware claim got denied aware person stil puting money acount smal amount monthly insisted paid atention spend money hung
Vehicle loan or lease,"I purchased a brand new XXXX Yamaha Wolverine R spec ( utv ) from my local yamaha dealer for roughly 15000 dollars on a loan when they first came out. I purchased an extended 4 year warranty through yamaha for full drive train coverage etc. after owning this machine for not even a year and  only having 1200 miles on it the motor went on a cold start one day. The dealer replaced everything from the crank up in the motor without figuring out why it went. This roughly cost 3500 dollars in parts and labor for yamaha i would assume. The dealer ran it around the building numerous times etc and i got it back in reasonable time. With all brand new parts the motor came apart again not even 150 miles later.. The dealer has pulled apart engine and wants to replace oil pump along with all new parts again but yamaha is refusing to cover the machine with over 2 years of warranty left. its clear that the machine has a lubrication issue within the motor yet are claiming this is all my fault. They went as far as offering me one part as good will and than sent me a cheesy sticker package in the mail. I still owe an outrageous amount of money on something i ca n't use. I had to cancel hunting trips etc and am still making all payments. The dealer has made numerous calls to Yamaha motors corporation only to have my claim denied time and time again. I have spent lots of my time on the phone and can not get any answers from the company. a person name XXXX with customer service has denied my claims and wo n't give me a direct answer about covering the machine. I feel that i am being treated very poorly and was sold a lemon that I 'm now stuck with. I 've owned numerous machines through this company and have never had an issue.
